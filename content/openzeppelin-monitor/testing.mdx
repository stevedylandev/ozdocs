This document provides information about testing OpenZeppelin Monitor, including running tests, generating coverage reports, and understanding the test structure.

## Test Organization

The project includes comprehensive test suites organized into different categories:

### Test Types

* ***Unit Tests***: Located within `src/` modules alongside the code they test
* ***Integration Tests***: Located in `tests/integration/` directory
* ***Property-based Tests***: Located in `tests/properties/` directory
* ***Mock Implementations***: Located in `tests/integration/mocks/`

### Test Structure

```

│   ├── filters/        # Filter logic tests
│   ├── fixtures/       # Test data and configurations
│   ├── mocks/          # Mock implementations
│   └── ...
├── properties/         # Property-based tests
│   ├── filters/        # Filter property tests
│   ├── notifications/  # Notification property tests
│   └── ...

```

## Running Tests

### All Tests

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
```



`RUST_TEST_THREADS=1` is required to prevent test conflicts when accessing shared resources like configuration files or network connections.


### Specific Test Categories

***Property-based Tests:***
```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test properties
```

***Integration Tests:***
```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test integration
```

***Unit Tests Only:***
```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test --lib
```

## Coverage Reports

### Prerequisites

Install the coverage tool:
```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```

### Generating Coverage

***HTML Coverage Report:***
```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo +stable llvm-cov --html --open
```

This generates an HTML report in `target/llvm-cov/html/` and opens it in your browser.

***Terminal Coverage Report:***
```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo +stable llvm-cov
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

***Tests hanging or timing out:***
- Ensure `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1` is set
- Verify mock setups are correct

***Coverage tool not found:***
- Install with `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`
- Add component with `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`

***Permission errors:***
- Ensure test directories are writable
- Check file permissions on test fixtures

### Debug Output

Enable debug logging for tests:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Contributing Tests

When contributing new features:

1. ***Add comprehensive tests*** for new functionality
2. ***Ensure all tests pass*** locally before submitting
3. ***Include both unit and integration tests*** where appropriate
4. ***Update test documentation*** if adding new test patterns
5. ***Maintain or improve code coverage***
