This document describes the high-level architecture of OpenZeppelin Monitor, including the core components, their interactions, and the overall system design. It provides a technical overview of how the service processes blockchain data and triggers notifications based on configurable conditions.

## System Overview

OpenZeppelin Monitor is organized as a data processing pipeline that spans from blockchain data collection to notification delivery. The system follows a modular architecture with distinct components for each step in the monitoring process, designed for scalability and extensibility.

### High-Level Architecture

```

### Data Flow Architecture

#### 1. Block Discovery Phase
The `BlockWatcherService` initiates the monitoring cycle by:

* Retrieving the last processed block number from `BlockStorage`
* Querying the blockchain for the latest block number
* Calculating the range of new blocks to process

#### 2. Data Retrieval Phase
The `BlockchainClient` fetches block data:

* Connects to the appropriate blockchain network via RPC
* Retrieves full block data including transactions and events
* Handles network-specific data formats and protocols

#### 3. Filtering Phase
The `FilterService` processes each block:

* Applies monitor-specific filters to transactions and events
* Evaluates match expressions and conditions
* Identifies relevant data that matches monitoring criteria

#### 4. Trigger Evaluation Phase
The `TriggerExecutionService` processes matches:

* Evaluates trigger conditions for matched data
* Prepares notification payloads with relevant context
* Determines which notification channels to activate

#### 5. Notification Delivery Phase
The `NotificationService` delivers alerts:

* Formats messages for each notification channel
* Handles channel-specific delivery protocols
* Manages delivery retries and error handling

#### 6. State Persistence Phase
The `BlockStorage` updates processing state:

* Records the latest processed block number
* Ensures data consistency for recovery scenarios
* Maintains processing history for debugging

### Error Handling and Resilience

The architecture includes several resilience mechanisms:

* ***Connection Pooling***: The `ClientPool` manages multiple connections to prevent single points of failure
* ***State Recovery***: `BlockStorage` enables the service to resume from the last known good state after restarts
* ***Retry Logic***: Notification delivery includes configurable retry mechanisms for transient failures
* ***Graceful Degradation***: Individual component failures don’t cascade to the entire system

For detailed information about RPC logic and network communication, see the [RPC section](/monitor/1.1.x/rpc).

## Configuration Architecture

The system uses a JSON-based configuration system organized into distinct categories:

### Configuration Categories

* ***Network Configurations***: Define blockchain network connections, RPC endpoints, and network parameters
* ***Monitor Configurations***: Specify monitoring rules, conditions, and network/trigger references
* ***Trigger Configurations***: Define notification settings and script definitions
* ***Filter Configurations***: Contain match filter scripts for data filtering

### Configuration Validation

The system implements comprehensive validation:

* Cross-reference validation between monitors, networks, and triggers
* Schema validation for all configuration files
* Runtime validation of configuration references during service startup



For configuration examples and best practices, see the [Configuration Guidelines](/monitor/1.1.x#configuration_guidelines) section in the user documentation.


## Extensibility Points

The architecture is designed for extensibility in several key areas:

### Blockchain Support
* ***Client Layer***: New blockchain protocols can be added by implementing the `BlockchainClient` trait
* ***Transport Layer***: Protocol-specific transport clients handle network communication details
* ***Filter Layer***: Chain-specific filters process protocol-dependent data formats

### Notification Channels
* ***Channel Plugins***: New notification channels can be added by implementing the notification interface
* ***Script Support***: Custom notification logic can be implemented using Python, JavaScript, or Bash scripts

### Monitoring Logic
* ***Expression Engine***: Flexible expression evaluation for complex monitoring conditions
* ***Script Triggers***: Custom trigger logic can be implemented using supported scripting languages

## Performance Considerations

The architecture is optimized for:

* ***Concurrent Processing***: Multiple networks can be monitored simultaneously
* ***Efficient Block Processing***: Batch processing of blocks to minimize RPC calls
* ***Memory Management***: Streaming processing of large blocks to prevent memory issues
* ***Connection Reuse***: Client pooling reduces connection overhead

## Security Architecture

The system implements several security measures:

* ***Secure Protocols***: Support for HTTPS/WSS
* ***Secret Management***: Secure handling of API keys and sensitive configuration data
* ***Input Validation***: Comprehensive validation of all external inputs and configurations
