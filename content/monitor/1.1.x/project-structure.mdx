title: Project Structure
---

This document describes the project structure and organization of the OpenZeppelin Monitor codebase, including the source code layout, configuration files, and development resources.

## Project Layout

The project follows a standard Rust project layout with additional directories for configuration, documentation, and operational resources:

```
openzeppelin-monitor/
├── src/                # Source code
│   ├── bootstrap/      # Bootstrap functions for the application
│   ├── models/         # Data structures and types
│   ├── repositories/   # Configuration storage
│   ├── services/       # Core business logic
│   ├── utils/          # Helper functions
│
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── tests/              # Integration and property-based tests
├── data/               # Runtime data storage
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts
├── cmd/                # Metrics and monitoring
├── examples/           # Example configuration files
└── ... other root files (Cargo.toml, README.md, etc.)
```

## Source Code Organization

### `src/` Directory

The main source code directory contains the core implementation files organized into several modules:

#### `bootstrap/`
Application initialization and setup for `main.rs`:

* Handles service initialization and dependency injection
* Manages the startup sequence and service lifecycle

#### `models/`
Core data structures and types:

* `blockchain/`: Platform-specific implementations
  * `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine specific types
  * `stellar/`: Stellar blockchain specific types
* `config/`: Configuration loading and validation
* `core/`: Core domain models
* `security/`: Security and secret management

#### `repositories/`
Configuration storage:

* Handles loading and validating configuration files
* Provides storage interfaces for monitors, networks, and triggers
* Implements validation of configuration references

#### `services/`
Core business logic:

* `blockchain/`: Blockchain client interfaces
  * `transports/`: Transport clients
    * `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine transport client
    * `stellar/`: Stellar transport client
  * `clients/`: Client implementations
    * `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine client
    * `stellar/`: Stellar client
* `blockwatcher/`: Block monitoring and processing
* `filter/`: Transaction and event filtering
  * `filters/`: Filter implementations
    * `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine filter
    * `stellar/`: Stellar filter
* `notification/`: Alert handling
* `trigger/`: Trigger evaluation and execution
  * `script/`: Script execution utilities

#### `utils/`
Helper functions:

* `cron_utils`: Cron schedule utilities
* `expression`: Expression evaluation
* `logging/`: Logging utilities
* `macros/`: Macros for common functionality
* `metrics/`: Metrics utilities
* `monitor/`: Monitor configuration test utilities
* `tests/`: Contains test utilities and helper functions
  * `builders/`: Test builder patterns implementing fluent interfaces for creating test fixtures
    * `evm/`: Builder implementations specific to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) testing
    * `stellar/`: Builder implementations specific to Stellar blockchain testing

## Configuration and Data

### `config/` Directory

Contains JSON configuration files for:

* ***Network configurations*** (`networks/`)
  * Connection details for blockchain networks
  * RPC endpoints and network parameters
* ***Monitor configurations*** (`monitors/`)
  * Monitoring rules and conditions
  * Network and trigger references
* ***Trigger configurations*** (`triggers/`)
  * Notification settings
  * Script definitions
* ***Filter configurations*** (`filters/`)
  * Match filter scripts



The `examples/config/` directory contains example JSON configuration files for each (network, monitor, trigger and filters).


### `data/` Directory

Runtime data storage:

* Block processing state
* Operational data
* Temporary files

<Callout>


The `data/`, `logs/` and `config/` directories are gitignored except for example files. These directories are mounted to persist the configs and runtime data.

</Callout>

## Examples and Resources

### `examples/` Directory

Provides practical examples and sample configurations to help users get started:

* Demonstrates typical service configurations for various networks
* Acts as a quick-start guide for customizing the monitor
* Serves as a reference for best practices in configuration

## Metrics and Monitoring

### `cmd/prometheus/` Directory

Prometheus exporters and monitoring infrastructure:

* `dashboards/`: Grafana dashboards
* `datasources/`: Prometheus datasources
* `prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration
* `grafana.ini`: Grafana configuration

## Testing and Documentation

### `tests/` Directory

Contains comprehensive test suites:

* Integration tests
* Property-based tests
* Mock implementations
* Test utilities and helpers

### `docs/` Directory

Project documentation:

* User guides
* API documentation
* Configuration examples
* Architecture diagrams

### `scripts/` Directory

Utility scripts for:

* Development workflows
* Documentation generation
* Build processes
* Deployment helpers

## Development Tools

### Pre-commit Hooks

Located in the project root:

* Code formatting checks
* Linting rules
* Commit message validation

### Build Configuration

Core build files:

* `Cargo.toml`: Project dependencies and metadata
* `rustfmt.toml`: Code formatting rules
* `rust-toolchain.toml`: Rust version and components

## Docker Support

The project includes Docker configurations for different environments:

* `Dockerfile.development`: Development container setup
* `Dockerfile.production`: Production-ready container
* Before running the docker compose set your env variables in `.env` according to your needs



For detailed information about running the monitor in containers, see the Docker deployment [section](/monitor/1.1.x#docker_installation) in the user documentation.
