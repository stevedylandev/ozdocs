title: Contracts Wizard Deploy Plugin
---

When configuring contracts from [Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), you can directly deploy the configured Smart Contract using your Defender account.

## Usage

### API Key generation
In your Defender dashboard, go to **Settings -> API Keys** and click **Create API Key**, you only need _Manage Deployments_ permission.

<Callout type='warn'>
We also recommend to set an expiration for the API Key, considering that is going to be used from an external site.
</Callout>

### Deployment from Contracts Wizard

Go to [Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) site, and after editing your contract, click on "Deploy with Defender".

Set your **API Key** and **API Secret** and press "Authenticate". You should see a message below the button indicating that the credentials are valid.

#### Approval Process
Here you have 3 options:

* Select an existing approval process from your **Deployment Environment** configured for the selected network.

<Callout>
If you have an existing deployment environment in the selected network, this is the only option allowed.
</Callout>

* If the **Deployment Envoronment** does not exist for the selected network, then you can create a new one.

<Callout>
If the Approval Process to be created is a Relayer, the API Key must include _Manage Relayers_ permission.
</Callout>

* Additionally, you can use the **injected provider** from Remix (a browser wallet) to deploy the contract, this will create a Defender **Deployment Environment** under the hood after deploying the contract.

#### Deploy
In this step, you should see the constructor inputs of your configured contract (if any), and the option to create a deterministic deployment.

<Callout>
This step is reactive, if you modify the contract you will see the new constructor arguments updated right after.
</Callout>

<Callout type='warn'>
Upgradable contracts are not yet fully supported. This action will only deploy the implementation contract without initializing. For safe upgrades, we strongly recommend usign [Upgrades Package](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades).
</Callout>

#### Deterministic Deployments

Defender Deploy supports a `salt` value to create deployments to deterministic addresses using `CREATE2`. Click on `Deterministic` checkbox and set the salt field to any arbitrary value.

<Callout>
If the approval process selected is a Multisig, the `salt` is required as Defender only support deterministic deployments when using Multisigs.
</Callout>

#### Further Steps

Once the contract deployment is submitted to Defender, in some cases you may need to complete the deployment from Defender Dashboard. You will see message indicating that the contract was submitted and a button that redirects to your Deployment in Defender.
