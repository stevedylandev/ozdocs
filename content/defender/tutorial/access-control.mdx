title: Modify and assign roles in a role-based access control smart contract
---

Defender allows you to seamlessly oversee and command contract permissions on a grand scale, with the power to view and control access at a granular level. This tutorial shows how to add a smart contract to see and manage its roles, including assigning and removing roles.

## Pre-requisites

* OpenZeppelin Defender account.
* Any external wallet (like Metamask) with an EOA that holds funds in Sepolia.

## 1. Add contract

<Callout>
For this tutorial, you will create a contract that implements the role-based Access Control library using [this](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xF909B3dBB525fDe7C3e8cd59FbECF3D42c217454) factory deployed to Sepolia. Your created contract will automatically assign you the admin role to manage its roles.
</Callout>

1. Open the Defender [Address Book](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/address-book/new) in a web browser.
2. Fill the form with the following values and click `Create`:

   * Name: `Access Control Factory`
   * Network: `Sepolia`
   * Address: `0xF909B3dBB525fDe7C3e8cd59FbECF3D42c217454`

1. Navigate to [Transaction Proposals](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/transaction-proposals/new?).
2. Fill the ***General Information*** section with the following values:

   * Name: `Create Access Control contract`
   * Target contract: `Access Control Factory`

1. For the ***Function*** section, select the `create` function.
2. Open the ***Approval Process*** section, click the input field and select `Create Approval Process`.
3. Fill the approval process form with the following values and click `Save Changes`:

   * Name: `Access Control Admin`
   * Type: `EOA`
   * Address: _Your wallet EOA address_
4. Connect your wallet with the EOA address of the approval process created and click `Submit Transaction Proposal`.

5. Click on the `Create Access Control contract` transaction proposal.
6. Click the top-right button `Approve and Execute` and confirm the transaction on your wallet.

7. Scroll down and under ***Execution Result***, hover over the first contract to copy its address.

8. Navigate to the Defender https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/address-book/new Address Book] to add your newly created contract.
9. Fill the form with the following values and click `Create`:

   * Name: `Access Control Contract`
   * Network: `Sepolia`
   * Address: _Contract address copied from the previous steps_
   * ABI: _Copy and paste the following_

```

1. Navigate to the [Access Control page](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/access-control/contracts).
2. Observe your newly added contract with the number addresses that hold the admin role.

3. Click on the contract card.

## 2. View and modify roles

In your contract-specific page, you can see the addresses that hold the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role, which is the EOA address from the approval process you used to deploy the contract. To make a change, click on the role and input the new address (or remove one address if you want to remove it from the role). Follow these steps to add a new address to the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`:

1. Click on the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role.
2. Select any address from the dropdown menu or add a new one.
3. Scroll down and click on `Select an Approval Process`.
4. Select your `Access Control Admin` approval process.
5. Check that your wallet is connected with the right EOA address. If not, click on the button below the field to connect your wallet.
6. Click on `Save Changes` and confirm the transaction on your wallet.
7. Wait for the transaction to get executed and check that the new address holds the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role.

For ownable contracts, you can only make changes to the `Owner` role using an approval process that matches the current owner’s address. When using a multisig as approval process, you will see the pending proposals on the right side of the page.

The page sync every minute, and updates when modifying a role.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You can import other contracts and modify their roles.

After configuring Access Control, we recommend seting up Workflows. Learn how to use Workflows with its tutorial [here](/defender/tutorial/workflows).
