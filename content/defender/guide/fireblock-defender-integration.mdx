   This will trigger Defender to generate a public/private key-pair. The CSR is then generated and signed with the private key and securely stored to prevent leakage.

## 2. Create Fireblocks API user
1. First, you will need to import the CSR within the Fireblocks UI when creating a new API user. Note that the API user will require any role that can _at least_ initiate transactions, e.g. Signer.

You should see an incomplete API key setup, which you can then edit and complete with the Fireblocks API key. Note that you will not be able to generate a new CSR file unless you complete the setup or delete the previous incomplete one.
