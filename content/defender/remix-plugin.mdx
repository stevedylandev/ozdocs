title: Remix Plugin
---

When coding and compiling contracts from [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), you can use Defender Plugin to deploy your contracts by configuring a [Deployment Environment](/defender/module/deploy) and using an Approval Process as deployer.

## Installation

1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and click on Plugin manager (bottom left corner).
2. Search **Defender Deploy** from the Modules list, and click "Activate".
3. A new tab in the left nav bar with the OpenZeppelin icon should be displayed.

## Usage

### API Key generation
In your Defender dashboard, go to **Settings -> API Keys** and click **Create API Key**, you only need _Manage Deployments_ permission.

<Callout type='warn'>
We also recommend to set an expiration for the API Key, considering that is going to be used from an external site.
</Callout>

### Deployment from Remix

Go to Remix IDE site, and open Defender plugin (see Installation step).

#### Setup
Set your **API Key** and **API Secret** and press "Authenticate". If the keys are valid, you should see a green tick in at the right indicating that you were succesfully authenticated, also a message in the Remix terminal.

#### Network
Select any of the supported networks. This also includes private and fork networks configured in your tenant.

#### Approval Process
Here you have 3 options:

* Select an existing approval process from your **Deployment Environment** configured for the selected network.

<Callout>
If you have an existing deployment environment in the selected network, this is the only option allowed.
</Callout>

* If the **Deployment Envoronment** does not exist for the selected network, then you can create a new one.

<Callout>
If the Approval Process to be created is a Relayer, the API Key must include _Manage Relayers_ permission.
</Callout>

* Additionally, you can use the **injected provider** from Remix (a browser wallet) to deploy the contract, this will create a Defender **Deployment Environment** under the hood after deploying the contract.

#### Deploy
You should see the latest compiled contract along with the constructor inputs.

<Callout>
In case you don’t see it, compile the target contract again, the Defender plug-in should detect the compilation and display the contructor inputs.
</Callout>

<Callout type='warn'>
Upgradable contracts are not yet fully supported. This action will only deploy the implementation contract without initializing. For safe upgrades, we strongly recommend usign [Upgrades Package](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades).
</Callout>

#### Deterministic Deployments

Defender Deploy supports a `salt` value to create deployments to deterministic addresses using `create2`. Click on `Deterministic` checkbox and set the salt field to any arbitrary value.

#### Further Steps

Once the contract deployment was submitted to Defender, in some cases you will need to complete the deployment from Defender Dashboard, you should see a green banner indicating that the contract was submitted and a link to your Deployment in Defender.
