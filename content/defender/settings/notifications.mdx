title: Notification Channels
---

Use Notification Channels to get notified about events across different Defender Modules, like Monitor Triggers, Workflows or Relayer Transactions lifecycle events.

## Supported Channels

### From Defender
* **Email**: Receive emails from the Defender trusted address: noreply@defender.openzeppelin.com
* **Webhooks**: Configure your own endpoints to receive signed notifications.

### Third Party Services
* [**Slack**](https://slack.com/).
* [**Telegram**](https://telegram.org/).
* [**Discord**](https://discord.com/).
* [**Datadog**](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
* [**PagerDuty**](https://www.pagerduty.com/).
* [**Opsgenie**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie).

## Setup

Go to **Settings -> Notification Channels** section and select and configure your preferred channel.

## Usage
The Notification Channel can be linked to any Defender module to get notified about events.

Also, it is possible to customize the notification template, [see how](/defender/module/monitor#customizing-notification).

## Additional configurations

### Webhook Secrets

As an additional security measure, Defender implements a Hash-based Message Authentication Code ([HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC)), by adding a `Defender-Signature` and `Defender-Timestamp` request headers to the notification sent to webhook endpoints. Therefore, the endpoint receiving the notification can verify the authenticity of the request.

Each webhook notification has a secret key associated that can be accessed under **Settings -> Notification Channnels -> Webhook details**.

The `Defender-Signature` is generated using [SHA256 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) and `webhook secret` to sign the payload and the timestamp.

<Callout>
Only Admin users in the Account have permission to see the webhook secret.

#### Signature Validation

##### Using Defender SDK

The authenticity of the signature can be validated using `verifySignature` utility function in [Defender SDK](/defender/sdk).

```js
function webhookHandler(req, res)
  const signature = req.headers['Defender-Signature'];
  const timestamp = req.headers['Defender-Timestamp'];

    const defender = new Defender({
      apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
      apiSecret: process.env.API_SECRET,
    );

    const result = client.notificationChannel.verifySignature(
      body: req.body,
      signature,
      timestamp,
      secret: process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET,
      validityInMs: 1000 * 60 * 10, // 10 mins
    );

    if (!result.valid) throw new Error(result.error);

    // your handler code
}
```

##### Manual Verification

The signature is generated using HMAC with `SHA256` algorithm, so it can be verified in any programming language using the right `Webhook Secret`.

##### Python example

<Callout>
This code example was tested in Python 3.12. For different versions, the code might be slightly different.
</Callout>

```py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, UTC
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_signature(body_object: dict, timestamp: str, signature: str secret: str) -> bool:
    # Parse the timestamp
    try:
        timestamp_dt = datetime.fromisoformat(timestamp)
    except ValueError:
        return False  # Invalid timestamp format

    # Get the current time and calculate the time difference
    current_time = datetime.now(UTC)
    time_difference = current_time - timestamp_dt

    # Check if the time difference is within the allowed range (10 minutes)
    if time_difference > timedelta(minutes=10):
        return False

    # Merge timestamp with body_object
    payload_to_verify = **body_object, 'timestamp': timestamp
    payload_to_verify_str = json.dumps(payload_to_verify, separators=(',', ':'))

    # Create a new HMAC object using the secret and the SHA256 hash algorithm
    hmac_obj = hmac.new(secret.encode(), payload_to_verify_str.encode(), hashlib.sha256)

    # Generate signature
    generated_signature = hmac_obj.hexdigest()

    # Compare the generated signature with the provided signature
    return hmac.compare_digest(generated_signature, signature)
```
