This directory includes primitives for on-chain governance.

## Governor

This modular system of Governor contracts allows the deployment on-chain voting protocols similar to [Compound’s Governor Alpha & Bravo](https://compound.finance/docs/governance) and beyond, through the ability to easily customize multiple aspects of the protocol.

<Callout>
For a guided experience, set up your Governor contract using [Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#governor).

For a written walkthrough, check out our guide on [How to set up on-chain governance](ROOT:governance.mdx).
</Callout>

* [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor): The core contract that contains all the logic and primitives. It is abstract and requires choosing one of each of the modules below, or custom ones.

Votes modules determine the source of voting power, and sometimes quorum number.

* [`GovernorVotes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorVotes): Extracts voting weight from an [`IVotes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#IVotes) contract.
* [`GovernorVotesQuorumFraction`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorVotesQuorumFraction): Combines with `GovernorVotes` to set the quorum as a fraction of the total token supply.
* [`GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFraction`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFraction): Combines `GovernorSuperQuorum` with `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction` to set the super quorum as a fraction of the total token supply.

Counting modules determine valid voting options.

* [`GovernorCountingSimple`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorCountingSimple): Simple voting mechanism with 3 voting options: Against, For and Abstain.
* [`GovernorCountingFractional`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorCountingFractional): A more modular voting system that allows a user to vote with only part of its voting power, and to split that weight arbitrarily between the 3 different options (Against, For and Abstain).
* [`GovernorCountingOverridable`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorCountingOverridable): An extended version of `GovernorCountingSimple` which allows delegatees to override their delegates while the vote is live. Must be used in conjunction with [`VotesExtended`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#VotesExtended).

Timelock extensions add a delay for governance decisions to be executed. The workflow is extended to require a `queue` step before execution. With these modules, proposals are executed by the external timelock contract, thus it is the timelock that has to hold the assets that are being governed.

* [`GovernorTimelockAccess`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorTimelockAccess): Connects with an instance of an [`AccessManager`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/access#AccessManager). This allows restrictions (and delays) enforced by the manager to be considered by the Governor and integrated into the AccessManager’s "schedule + execute" workflow.
* [`GovernorTimelockControl`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorTimelockControl): Connects with an instance of [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController). Allows multiple proposers and executors, in addition to the Governor itself.
* [`GovernorTimelockCompound`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorTimelockCompound): Connects with an instance of Compound’s [`Timelock`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Timelock.sol) contract.

Other extensions can customize the behavior or interface in multiple ways.

* [`GovernorStorage`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorStorage): Stores the proposal details onchain and provides enumerability of the proposals. This can be useful for some L2 chains where storage is cheap compared to calldata.
* [`GovernorSettings`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorSettings): Manages some of the settings (voting delay, voting period duration, and proposal threshold) in a way that can be updated through a governance proposal, without requiring an upgrade.
* [`GovernorPreventLateQuorum`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorPreventLateQuorum): Ensures there is a minimum voting period after quorum is reached as a security protection against large voters.
* [`GovernorProposalGuardian`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorProposalGuardian): Adds a proposal guardian that can cancel proposals at any stage in their lifecycle--this permission is passed on to the proposers if the guardian is not set.
* [`GovernorSuperQuorum`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorSuperQuorum): Extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) with a super quorum. Proposals that meet the super quorum (and have a majority of for votes) advance to the `Succeeded` state before the proposal deadline.
* [`GovernorNoncesKeyed`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorNoncesKeyed): An extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) with support for keyed nonces in addition to traditional nonces when voting by signature.

In addition to modules and extensions, the core contract requires a few virtual functions to be implemented to your particular specifications:

* [`votingDelay()`](#Governor-votingDelay-): Delay (in ERC-6372 clock) since the proposal is submitted until voting power is fixed and voting starts. This can be used to enforce a delay after a proposal is published for users to buy tokens, or delegate their votes.
* [`votingPeriod()`](#Governor-votingPeriod-): Delay (in ERC-6372 clock) since the proposal starts until voting ends.
* [`quorum(uint256 timepoint)`](#Governor-quorum-uint256-): Quorum required for a proposal to be successful. This function includes a `timepoint` argument (see ERC-6372) so the quorum can adapt through time, for example, to follow a token’s `totalSupply`.

<Callout>
Functions of the `Governor` contract do not include access control. If you want to restrict access, you should add these checks by overloading the particular functions. Among these, [`Governor._cancel`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-cancel) is internal by default, and you will have to expose it (with the right access control mechanism) yourself if this function is needed.

## Timelock

In a governance system, the [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController) contract is in charge of introducing a delay between a proposal and its execution. It can be used with or without a [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor).

[`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController)

#### Terminology

* **Operation:** A transaction (or a set of transactions) that is the subject of the timelock. It has to be scheduled by a proposer and executed by an executor. The timelock enforces a minimum delay between the proposition and the execution. If the operation contains multiple transactions (batch mode), they are executed atomically. Operations are identified by the hash of their content.
* **Operation status:**
  * **Unset:** An operation that is not part of the timelock mechanism.
  * **Waiting:** An operation that has been scheduled, before the timer expires.
  * **Ready:** An operation that has been scheduled, after the timer expires.
  * **Pending:** An operation that is either waiting or ready.
  * **Done:** An operation that has been executed.
* **Predecessor**: An (optional) dependency between operations. An operation can depend on another operation (its predecessor), forcing the execution order of these two operations.
* **Role**:
  * **Admin:** An address (smart contract or EOA) that is in charge of granting the roles of Proposer and Executor.
  * **Proposer:** An address (smart contract or EOA) that is in charge of scheduling (and cancelling) operations.
  * **Executor:** An address (smart contract or EOA) that is in charge of executing operations once the timelock has expired. This role can be given to the zero address to allow anyone to execute operations.

#### Operation structure

Operation executed by the [`TimelockController`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController) can contain one or multiple subsequent calls. Depending on whether you need to multiple calls to be executed atomically, you can either use simple or batched operations.

Both operations contain:

* **Target**, the address of the smart contract that the timelock should operate on.
* **Value**, in wei, that should be sent with the transaction. Most of the time this will be 0. Ether can be deposited before-end or passed along when executing the transaction.
* **Data**, containing the encoded function selector and parameters of the call. This can be produced using a number of tools. For example, a maintenance operation granting role `ROLE` to `ACCOUNT` can be encoded using web3js as follows:

```javascript
const data = timelock.contract.methods.grantRole(ROLE, ACCOUNT).encodeABI()
```

* **Predecessor**, that specifies a dependency between operations. This dependency is optional. Use `bytes32(0)` if the operation does not have any dependency.
* **Salt**, used to disambiguate two otherwise identical operations. This can be any random value.

In the case of batched operations, `target`, `value` and `data` are specified as arrays, which must be of the same length.

#### Operation lifecycle

Timelocked operations are identified by a unique id (their hash) and follow a specific lifecycle:

`Unset` -> `Pending` -> `Pending` + `Ready` -> `Done`

* By calling [`schedule`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-schedule-address-uint256-bytes-bytes32-bytes32-uint256-) (or [`scheduleBatch`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-scheduleBatch-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-bytes32-uint256-)), a proposer moves the operation from the `Unset` to the `Pending` state. This starts a timer that must be longer than the minimum delay. The timer expires at a timestamp accessible through the [`getTimestamp`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-getTimestamp-bytes32-) method.
* Once the timer expires, the operation automatically gets the `Ready` state. At this point, it can be executed.
* By calling [`execute`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-TimelockController-execute-address-uint256-bytes-bytes32-bytes32-) (or [`executeBatch`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-executeBatch-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-bytes32-)), an executor triggers the operation’s underlying transactions and moves it to the `Done` state. If the operation has a predecessor, it has to be in the `Done` state for this transition to succeed.
* [`cancel`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-TimelockController-cancel-bytes32-) allows proposers to cancel any `Pending` operation. This resets the operation to the `Unset` state. It is thus possible for a proposer to re-schedule an operation that has been cancelled. In this case, the timer restarts when the operation is rescheduled.

Operations status can be queried using the functions:

* [`isOperationPending(bytes32)`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-isOperationPending-bytes32-)
* [`isOperationReady(bytes32)`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-isOperationReady-bytes32-)
* [`isOperationDone(bytes32)`](contracts/v5.x/api/governance.mdx#TimelockController-isOperationDone-bytes32-)

#### Roles

##### Admin

The admins are in charge of managing proposers and executors. For the timelock to be self-governed, this role should only be given to the timelock itself. Upon deployment, the admin role can be granted to any address (in addition to the timelock itself). After further configuration and testing, this optional admin should renounce its role such that all further maintenance operations have to go through the timelock process.

##### Proposer

The proposers are in charge of scheduling (and cancelling) operations. This is a critical role, that should be given to governing entities. This could be an EOA, a multisig, or a DAO.

<Callout type='warn'>
**Proposer fight:** Having multiple proposers, while providing redundancy in case one becomes unavailable, can be dangerous. As proposer have their say on all operations, they could cancel operations they disagree with, including operations to remove them for the proposers.
</Callout>

This role is identified by the **PROPOSER_ROLE** value: `0xb09aa5aeb3702cfd50b6b62bc4532604938f21248a27a1d5ca736082b6819cc1`

##### Executor

The executors are in charge of executing the operations scheduled by the proposers once the timelock expires. Logic dictates that multisig or DAO that are proposers should also be executors in order to guarantee operations that have been scheduled will eventually be executed. However, having additional executors can reduce the cost (the executing transaction does not require validation by the multisig or DAO that proposed it), while ensuring whoever is in charge of execution cannot trigger actions that have not been scheduled by the proposers. Alternatively, it is possible to allow _any_ address to execute a proposal once the timelock has expired by granting the executor role to the zero address.

This role is identified by the **EXECUTOR_ROLE** value: `0xd8aa0f3194971a2a116679f7c2090f6939c8d4e01a2a8d7e41d55e5351469e63`

**⚠️ WARNING**\
A live contract without at least one proposer and one executor is locked. Make sure these roles are filled by reliable entities before the deployer renounces its administrative rights in favour of the timelock contract itself. See the [`AccessControl`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/access#AccessControl) documentation to learn more about role management.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-onlyGovernance--"></a>

### `onlyGovernance()`

Restricts a function so it can only be executed through governance proposals. For example, governance
parameter setters in [`GovernorSettings`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorSettings) are protected using this modifier.

The governance executing address may be different from the Governor's own address, for example it could be a
timelock. This can be customized by modules by overriding [`GovernorUpgradeable._executor`](#GovernorUpgradeable-_executor--). The executor is only able to invoke these
functions during the execution of the governor's [`AccessManagerUpgradeable.execute`](access#AccessManagerUpgradeable-execute-address-bytes-) function, and not under any other circumstances. Thus,
for example, additional timelock proposers are not able to change governance parameters without going through the
governance protocol (since v4.6).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-__Governor_init-string-"></a>

### `__Governor_init(string name_)`
*internal*

Sets the value for [`GovernorUpgradeable.name`](#GovernorUpgradeable-name--) and [`GovernorUpgradeable.version`](#GovernorUpgradeable-version--)

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-__Governor_init_unchained-string-"></a>

### `__Governor_init_unchained(string name_)`
*internal*

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-receive--"></a>

### `receive()`
*external*

Function to receive ETH that will be handled by the governor (disabled if executor is a third party contract)

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-supportsInterface-bytes4-"></a>

### `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) → bool`
*public*

Returns true if this contract implements the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. See the corresponding
[ERC section](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165#how-interfaces-are-identified)
to learn more about how these ids are created.

This function call must use less than 30 000 gas.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-name--"></a>

### `name() → string`
*public*

Name of the governor instance (used in building the EIP-712 domain separator).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-version--"></a>

### `version() → string`
*public*

Version of the governor instance (used in building the EIP-712 domain separator). Default: "1"

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-hashProposal-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `hashProposal(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) → uint256`
*public*

See [`IGovernor.hashProposal`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#IGovernor-hashProposal).

The proposal id is produced by hashing the ABI encoded `targets` array, the `values` array, the `calldatas` array
and the descriptionHash (bytes32 which itself is the keccak256 hash of the description string). This proposal id
can be produced from the proposal data which is part of the [`ProposalCreated`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/utils#ProposalCreated) event. It can even be computed in
advance, before the proposal is submitted.

Note that the chainId and the governor address are not part of the proposal id computation. Consequently, the
same proposal (with same operation and same description) will have the same id if submitted on multiple governors
across multiple networks. This also means that in order to execute the same operation twice (on the same
governor) the proposer will have to change the description in order to avoid proposal id conflicts.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-getProposalId-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `getProposalId(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) → uint256`
*public*

Function used to get the proposal id from the proposal details.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-state-uint256-"></a>

### `state(uint256 proposalId) → enum IGovernor.ProposalState`
*public*

Current state of a proposal, following Compound's convention

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-proposalThreshold--"></a>

### `proposalThreshold() → uint256`
*public*

The number of votes required in order for a voter to become a proposer.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-proposalSnapshot-uint256-"></a>

### `proposalSnapshot(uint256 proposalId) → uint256`
*public*

Timepoint used to retrieve user's votes and quorum. If using block number (as per Compound's Comp), the
snapshot is performed at the end of this block. Hence, voting for this proposal starts at the beginning of the
following block.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-proposalDeadline-uint256-"></a>

### `proposalDeadline(uint256 proposalId) → uint256`
*public*

Timepoint at which votes close. If using block number, votes close at the end of this block, so it is
possible to cast a vote during this block.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-proposalProposer-uint256-"></a>

### `proposalProposer(uint256 proposalId) → address`
*public*

The account that created a proposal.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-proposalEta-uint256-"></a>

### `proposalEta(uint256 proposalId) → uint256`
*public*

The time when a queued proposal becomes executable ("ETA"). Unlike [`GovernorUpgradeable.proposalSnapshot`](#GovernorUpgradeable-proposalSnapshot-uint256-) and
[`GovernorUpgradeable.proposalDeadline`](#GovernorUpgradeable-proposalDeadline-uint256-), this doesn't use the governor clock, and instead relies on the executor's clock which may be
different. In most cases this will be a timestamp.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-proposalNeedsQueuing-uint256-"></a>

### `proposalNeedsQueuing(uint256) → bool`
*public*

Whether a proposal needs to be queued before execution.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_checkGovernance--"></a>

### `_checkGovernance()`
*internal*

Reverts if the `msg.sender` is not the executor. In case the executor is not this contract
itself, the function reverts if `msg.data` is not whitelisted as a result of an [`AccessManagerUpgradeable.execute`](access#AccessManagerUpgradeable-execute-address-bytes-)
operation. See [`GovernorUpgradeable.onlyGovernance`](#GovernorUpgradeable-onlyGovernance--).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_quorumReached-uint256-"></a>

### `_quorumReached(uint256 proposalId) → bool`
*internal*

Amount of votes already cast passes the threshold limit.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_voteSucceeded-uint256-"></a>

### `_voteSucceeded(uint256 proposalId) → bool`
*internal*

Is the proposal successful or not.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_getVotes-address-uint256-bytes-"></a>

### `_getVotes(address account, uint256 timepoint, bytes params) → uint256`
*internal*

Get the voting weight of `account` at a specific `timepoint`, for a vote as described by `params`.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_countVote-uint256-address-uint8-uint256-bytes-"></a>

### `_countVote(uint256 proposalId, address account, uint8 support, uint256 totalWeight, bytes params) → uint256`
*internal*

Register a vote for `proposalId` by `account` with a given `support`, voting `weight` and voting `params`.

Note: Support is generic and can represent various things depending on the voting system used.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_tallyUpdated-uint256-"></a>

### `_tallyUpdated(uint256 proposalId)`
*internal*

Hook that should be called every time the tally for a proposal is updated.

Note: This function must run successfully. Reverts will result in the bricking of governance

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_defaultParams--"></a>

### `_defaultParams() → bytes`
*internal*

Default additional encoded parameters used by castVote methods that don't include them

Note: Should be overridden by specific implementations to use an appropriate value, the
meaning of the additional params, in the context of that implementation

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-propose-address---uint256---bytes---string-"></a>

### `propose(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, string description) → uint256`
*public*

See [`IGovernor.propose`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#IGovernor-propose). This function has opt-in frontrunning protection, described in [`GovernorUpgradeable._isValidDescriptionForProposer`](#GovernorUpgradeable-_isValidDescriptionForProposer-address-string-).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_propose-address---uint256---bytes---string-address-"></a>

### `_propose(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, string description, address proposer) → uint256 proposalId`
*internal*

Internal propose mechanism. Can be overridden to add more logic on proposal creation.

Emits a [`IGovernor.ProposalCreated`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#IGovernor-ProposalCreated) event.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-queue-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `queue(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) → uint256`
*public*

Queue a proposal. Some governors require this step to be performed before execution can happen. If queuing
is not necessary, this function may revert.
Queuing a proposal requires the quorum to be reached, the vote to be successful, and the deadline to be reached.

Emits a [`ProposalQueued`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/utils#ProposalQueued) event.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_queueOperations-uint256-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `_queueOperations(uint256, address[], uint256[], bytes[], bytes32) → uint48`
*internal*

Internal queuing mechanism. Can be overridden (without a super call) to modify the way queuing is
performed (for example adding a vault/timelock).

This is empty by default, and must be overridden to implement queuing.

This function returns a timestamp that describes the expected ETA for execution. If the returned value is 0
(which is the default value), the core will consider queueing did not succeed, and the public [`GovernorUpgradeable.queue`](#GovernorUpgradeable-queue-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-) function
will revert.

<Callout>
Calling this function directly will NOT check the current state of the proposal, or emit the
</Callout>
`ProposalQueued` event. Queuing a proposal should be done using [`GovernorUpgradeable.queue`](#GovernorUpgradeable-queue-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-execute-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `execute(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) → uint256`
*public*

Execute a successful proposal. This requires the quorum to be reached, the vote to be successful, and the
deadline to be reached. Depending on the governor it might also be required that the proposal was queued and
that some delay passed.

Emits a [`ProposalExecuted`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/utils#ProposalExecuted) event.

<Callout>
Some modules can modify the requirements for execution, for example by adding an additional timelock.
</Callout>

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_executeOperations-uint256-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `_executeOperations(uint256, address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32)`
*internal*

Internal execution mechanism. Can be overridden (without a super call) to modify the way execution is
performed (for example adding a vault/timelock).

<Callout>
Calling this function directly will NOT check the current state of the proposal, set the executed flag to
</Callout>
true or emit the `ProposalExecuted` event. Executing a proposal should be done using [`AccessManagerUpgradeable.execute`](access#AccessManagerUpgradeable-execute-address-bytes-).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-cancel-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `cancel(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) → uint256`
*public*

Cancel a proposal. A proposal is cancellable by the proposer, but only while it is Pending state, i.e.
before the vote starts.

Emits a [`ProposalCanceled`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/utils#ProposalCanceled) event.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_cancel-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `_cancel(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) → uint256`
*internal*

Canceled, Expired, or Executed. Once cancelled a proposal can't be re-submitted.

Emits a [`IGovernor.ProposalCanceled`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#IGovernor-ProposalCanceled) event.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-getVotes-address-uint256-"></a>

### `getVotes(address account, uint256 timepoint) → uint256`
*public*

Voting power of an `account` at a specific `timepoint`.

Note: this can be implemented in a number of ways, for example by reading the delegated balance from one (or
multiple), [`ERC20Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC20#ERC20Votes) tokens.

Emits a [`IGovernor.VoteCast`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#IGovernor-VoteCast) event.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-relay-address-uint256-bytes-"></a>

### `relay(address target, uint256 value, bytes data)`
*external*

Relays a transaction or function call to an arbitrary target. In cases where the governance executor
is some contract other than the governor itself, like when using a timelock, this function can be invoked
in a governance proposal to recover tokens or Ether that was sent to the governor contract by mistake.
Note that if the executor is simply the governor itself, use of `relay` is redundant.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_executor--"></a>

### `_executor() → address`
*internal*

Address through which the governor executes action. Will be overloaded by module that execute actions
through another contract such as a timelock.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-"></a>

### `onERC721Received(address, address, uint256, bytes) → bytes4`
*public*

See [`IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received).
Receiving tokens is disabled if the governance executor is other than the governor itself (eg. when using with a timelock).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-onERC1155Received-address-address-uint256-uint256-bytes-"></a>

### `onERC1155Received(address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes) → bytes4`
*public*

See [`IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC1155#IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155Received).
Receiving tokens is disabled if the governance executor is other than the governor itself (eg. when using with a timelock).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-onERC1155BatchReceived-address-address-uint256---uint256---bytes-"></a>

*public*

See [`IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155BatchReceived`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC1155#IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155BatchReceived).
Receiving tokens is disabled if the governance executor is other than the governor itself (eg. when using with a timelock).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_encodeStateBitmap-enum-IGovernor-ProposalState-"></a>

### `_encodeStateBitmap(enum IGovernor.ProposalState proposalState) → bytes32`
*internal*

Encodes a `ProposalState` into a `bytes32` representation where each bit enabled corresponds to
the underlying position in the `ProposalState` enum. For example:

0x000...10000
  ^^^^^^------ ...
        ^----- Succeeded
         ^---- Defeated
          ^--- Canceled
           ^-- Active
            ^- Pending

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_validateStateBitmap-uint256-bytes32-"></a>

### `_validateStateBitmap(uint256 proposalId, bytes32 allowedStates) → enum IGovernor.ProposalState`
*internal*

Check that the current state of a proposal matches the requirements described by the `allowedStates` bitmap.
This bitmap should be built using `_encodeStateBitmap`.

If requirements are not met, reverts with a [`GovernorUnexpectedProposalState`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorUnexpectedProposalState) error.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_isValidDescriptionForProposer-address-string-"></a>

### `_isValidDescriptionForProposer(address proposer, string description) → bool`
*internal*

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-_validateCancel-uint256-address-"></a>

### `_validateCancel(uint256 proposalId, address caller) → bool`

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-clock--"></a>

### `clock() → uint48`
*public*

Clock used for flagging checkpoints. Can be overridden to implement timestamp based checkpoints (and voting).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-CLOCK_MODE--"></a>

### `CLOCK_MODE() → string`
*public*

Description of the clock

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-votingDelay--"></a>

### `votingDelay() → uint256`
*public*

Delay, between the proposal is created and the vote starts. The unit this duration is expressed in depends
on the clock (see ERC-6372) this contract uses.

This can be increased to leave time for users to buy voting power, or delegate it, before the voting of a
proposal starts.

<Callout>
While this interface returns a uint256, timepoints are stored as uint48 following the ERC-6372 clock type.
</Callout>
Consequently this value must fit in a uint48 (when added to the current clock). See [`IERC6372.clock`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token#IERC6372-clock).

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-votingPeriod--"></a>

### `votingPeriod() → uint256`
*public*

Delay between the vote start and vote end. The unit this duration is expressed in depends on the clock
(see ERC-6372) this contract uses.

<Callout>
The [`GovernorUpgradeable.votingDelay`](#GovernorUpgradeable-votingDelay--) can delay the start of the vote. This must be considered when setting the voting
</Callout>
duration compared to the voting delay.

<Callout>
This value is stored when the proposal is submitted so that possible changes to the value do not affect
</Callout>
proposals that have already been submitted. The type used to save it is a uint32. Consequently, while this
interface returns a uint256, the value it returns should fit in a uint32.

<a id="GovernorUpgradeable-quorum-uint256-"></a>

### `quorum(uint256 timepoint) → uint256`
*public*

Minimum number of cast voted required for a proposal to be successful.

<Callout>
The `timepoint` parameter corresponds to the snapshot used for counting vote. This allows to scale the
</Callout>
quorum depending on values such as the totalSupply of a token at this timepoint (see [`ERC20Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC20#ERC20Votes)).

<a id="TimelockControllerUpgradeable"></a>

## `TimelockControllerUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/TimelockControllerUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/TimelockControllerUpgradeable.sol";
```

Contract module which acts as a timelocked controller. When set as the
owner of an `Ownable` smart contract, it enforces a timelock on all
`onlyOwner` maintenance operations. This gives time for users of the
controlled contract to exit before a potentially dangerous maintenance
operation is applied.

By default, this contract is self administered, meaning administration tasks
have to go through the timelock process. The proposer (resp executor) role
is in charge of proposing (resp executing) operations. A common use case is
to position this [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController) as the owner of a smart contract, with
a multisig or a DAO as the sole proposer.

<a id="TimelockControllerUpgradeable-onlyRoleOrOpenRole-bytes32-"></a>

### `onlyRoleOrOpenRole(bytes32 role)`

Modifier to make a function callable only by a certain role. In
addition to checking the sender's role, `address(0)` 's role is also
considered. Granting a role to `address(0)` is equivalent to enabling
this role for everyone.

### `__TimelockController_init(uint256 minDelay, address[] proposers, address[] executors, address admin)`
*internal*

Initializes the contract with the following parameters:

- `minDelay`: initial minimum delay in seconds for operations
- `proposers`: accounts to be granted proposer and canceller roles
- `executors`: accounts to be granted executor role
- `admin`: optional account to be granted admin role; disable with zero address

<Callout type='warn'>
The optional admin can aid with initial configuration of roles after deployment
</Callout>
without being subject to delay, but this role should be subsequently renounced in favor of
administration through timelocked proposals. Previous versions of this contract would assign
this admin to the deployer automatically and should be renounced as well.

## `GovernorCountingFractionalUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorCountingFractionalUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorCountingFractionalUpgradeable.sol";
```

Extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) for fractional voting.

Similar to [`GovernorCountingSimple`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorCountingSimple), this contract is a votes counting module for [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) that supports 3 options:
Against, For, Abstain. Additionally, it includes a fourth option: Fractional, which allows voters to split their voting
power amongst the other 3 options.

Votes cast with the Fractional support must be accompanied by a `params` argument that is three packed `uint128` values
representing the weight the delegate assigns to Against, For, and Abstain respectively. For those votes cast for the other
3 options, the `params` argument must be empty.

This is mostly useful when the delegate is a contract that implements its own rules for voting. These delegate-contracts
can cast fractional votes according to the preferences of multiple entities delegating their voting power.

Some example use cases include:

* Voting from tokens that are held by a DeFi pool
* Voting from an L2 with tokens held by a bridge
* Voting privately from a shielded pool using zero knowledge proofs.

Based on ScopeLift's [`GovernorCountingFractional`](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/e5de2efd1368387b840931f19f3c184c85842761/src/GovernorCountingFractional.sol)

### `COUNTING_MODE() → string`
*public*

A description of the possible `support` values for [`GovernorUpgradeable.castVote`](#GovernorUpgradeable-castVote-uint256-uint8-) and the way these votes are counted, meant to
be consumed by UIs to show correct vote options and interpret the results. The string is a URL-encoded sequence of
key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

- `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.
- `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
- `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique
name that describes the behavior. For example:

- `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.
- `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

### `_countVote(uint256 proposalId, address account, uint8 support, uint256 totalWeight, bytes params) → uint256`
*internal*

See [`Governor._countVote`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-countVote). Function that records the delegate's votes.

Executing this function consumes (part of) the delegate's weight on the proposal. This weight can be
distributed amongst the 3 options (Against, For, Abstain) by specifying a fractional `support`.

This counting module supports two vote casting modes: nominal and fractional.

- Nominal: A nominal vote is cast by setting `support` to one of the 3 bravo options (Against, For, Abstain).
- Fractional: A fractional vote is cast by setting `support` to `type(uint8).max` (255).

Casting a nominal vote requires `params` to be empty and consumes the delegate's full remaining weight on the
proposal for the specified `support` option. This is similar to the [`GovernorCountingSimple`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorCountingSimple) module and follows
the `VoteType` enum from Governor Bravo. As a consequence, no vote weight remains unspent so no further voting
is possible (for this `proposalId` and this `account`).

Casting a fractional vote consumes a fraction of the delegate's remaining weight on the proposal according to the
weights the delegate assigns to each support option (Against, For, Abstain respectively). The sum total of the
three decoded vote weights _must_ be less than or equal to the delegate's remaining weight on the proposal (i.e.
their checkpointed total weight minus votes already cast on the proposal). This format can be produced using:

`abi.encodePacked(uint128(againstVotes), uint128(forVotes), uint128(abstainVotes))`

<Callout>
Consider that fractional voting restricts the number of casted votes (in each category) to 128 bits.
</Callout>
Depending on how many decimals the underlying token has, a single voter may require to split their vote into
multiple vote operations. For precision higher than ~30 decimals, large token holders may require a
potentially large number of calls to cast all their votes. The voter has the possibility to cast all the
remaining votes in a single operation using the traditional "bravo" vote.

### `GovernorExceedRemainingWeight(address voter, uint256 usedVotes, uint256 remainingWeight)`
*error*

A fractional vote params uses more votes than are available for that user.

### `COUNTING_MODE() → string`
*public*

A description of the possible `support` values for [`GovernorUpgradeable.castVote`](#GovernorUpgradeable-castVote-uint256-uint8-) and the way these votes are counted, meant to
be consumed by UIs to show correct vote options and interpret the results. The string is a URL-encoded sequence of
key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

- `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.
- `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
- `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique
name that describes the behavior. For example:

- `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.
- `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

The string can be decoded by the standard

<Callout>
Calling [`GovernorUpgradeable.castVote`](#GovernorUpgradeable-castVote-uint256-uint8-) (or similar) casts a vote using the voting power that is delegated to the voter.
</Callout>
Conversely, calling [`GovernorCountingOverridableUpgradeable.castOverrideVote`](#GovernorCountingOverridableUpgradeable-castOverrideVote-uint256-uint8-string-) (or similar) uses the voting power of the account itself, from its asset
balances. Casting an "override vote" does not count as voting and won't be reflected by this getter. Consider
using [`GovernorCountingOverridableUpgradeable.hasVotedOverride`](#GovernorCountingOverridableUpgradeable-hasVotedOverride-uint256-address-) to check if an account has casted an "override vote" for a given proposal id.

### `COUNTING_MODE() → string`
*public*

A description of the possible `support` values for [`GovernorUpgradeable.castVote`](#GovernorUpgradeable-castVote-uint256-uint8-) and the way these votes are counted, meant to
be consumed by UIs to show correct vote options and interpret the results. The string is a URL-encoded sequence of
key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

- `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.
- `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
- `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique
name that describes the behavior. For example:

- `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.
- `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

The string can be decoded by the standard

## `GovernorNoncesKeyedUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorNoncesKeyedUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorNoncesKeyedUpgradeable.sol";
```

An extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) that extends existing nonce management to use [`NoncesKeyed`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/utils#NoncesKeyed), where the key is the low-order 192 bits of the `proposalId`.
This is useful for voting by signature while maintaining separate sequences of nonces for each proposal.

<Callout>
Traditional (un-keyed) nonces are still supported and can continue to be used as if this extension was not present.
</Callout>

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable.sol";
```

A module that ensures there is a minimum voting period after quorum is reached. This prevents a large voter from
swaying a vote and triggering quorum at the last minute, by ensuring there is always time for other voters to react
and try to oppose the decision.

If a vote causes quorum to be reached, the proposal's voting period may be extended so that it does not end before at
least a specified time has passed (the "vote extension" parameter). This parameter can be set through a governance
proposal.

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-__GovernorPreventLateQuorum_init-uint48-"></a>

### `__GovernorPreventLateQuorum_init(uint48 initialVoteExtension)`
*internal*

Initializes the vote extension parameter: the time in either number of blocks or seconds (depending on the
governor clock mode) that is required to pass since the moment a proposal reaches quorum until its voting period
ends. If necessary the voting period will be extended beyond the one set during proposal creation.

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-__GovernorPreventLateQuorum_init_unchained-uint48-"></a>

### `__GovernorPreventLateQuorum_init_unchained(uint48 initialVoteExtension)`
*internal*

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-proposalDeadline-uint256-"></a>

### `proposalDeadline(uint256 proposalId) → uint256`
*public*

Returns the proposal deadline, which may have been extended beyond that set at proposal creation, if the
proposal reached quorum late in the voting period. See [`Governor.proposalDeadline`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-proposalDeadline).

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-_tallyUpdated-uint256-"></a>

### `_tallyUpdated(uint256 proposalId)`
*internal*

Vote tally updated and detects if it caused quorum to be reached, potentially extending the voting period.

May emit a [`ProposalExtended`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#ProposalExtended) event.

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-lateQuorumVoteExtension--"></a>

### `lateQuorumVoteExtension() → uint48`
*public*

Returns the current value of the vote extension parameter: the number of blocks that are required to pass
from the time a proposal reaches quorum until its voting period ends.

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-setLateQuorumVoteExtension-uint48-"></a>

### `setLateQuorumVoteExtension(uint48 newVoteExtension)`
*public*

Changes the [`GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable.lateQuorumVoteExtension`](#GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-lateQuorumVoteExtension--). This operation can only be performed by the governance executor,
generally through a governance proposal.

Emits a [`LateQuorumVoteExtensionSet`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#LateQuorumVoteExtensionSet) event.

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-_setLateQuorumVoteExtension-uint48-"></a>

### `_setLateQuorumVoteExtension(uint48 newVoteExtension)`
*internal*

Changes the [`GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable.lateQuorumVoteExtension`](#GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-lateQuorumVoteExtension--). This is an internal function that can be exposed in a public function
like [`GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable.setLateQuorumVoteExtension`](#GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-setLateQuorumVoteExtension-uint48-) if another access control mechanism is needed.

Emits a [`LateQuorumVoteExtensionSet`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#LateQuorumVoteExtensionSet) event.

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-ProposalExtended-uint256-uint64-"></a>

### `ProposalExtended(uint256 indexed proposalId, uint64 extendedDeadline)`
*event*

Emitted when a proposal deadline is pushed back due to reaching quorum late in its voting period.

<a id="GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-LateQuorumVoteExtensionSet-uint64-uint64-"></a>

### `LateQuorumVoteExtensionSet(uint64 oldVoteExtension, uint64 newVoteExtension)`
*event*

Emitted when the [`GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable.lateQuorumVoteExtension`](#GovernorPreventLateQuorumUpgradeable-lateQuorumVoteExtension--) parameter is changed.

<a id="GovernorProposalGuardianUpgradeable"></a>

## `GovernorProposalGuardianUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorProposalGuardianUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorProposalGuardianUpgradeable.sol";
```

Extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) which adds a proposal guardian that can cancel proposals at any stage in the proposal's lifecycle.

<Callout>
if the proposal guardian is not configured, then proposers take this role for their proposals.

## `GovernorStorageUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorStorageUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorStorageUpgradeable.sol";
```

Extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) that implements storage of proposal details. This modules also provides primitives for
the enumerability of proposals.

Use cases for this module include:
- UIs that explore the proposal state without relying on event indexing.
- Using only the proposalId as an argument in the [`Governor.queue`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-queue) and [`Governor.execute`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-execute) functions for L2 chains
  where storage is cheap compared to calldata.

### `__GovernorSuperQuorum_init_unchained()`
*internal*

<a id="GovernorSuperQuorumUpgradeable-superQuorum-uint256-"></a>

### `superQuorum(uint256 timepoint) → uint256`
*public*

Minimum number of cast votes required for a proposal to reach super quorum. Only FOR votes are counted
towards the super quorum. Once the super quorum is reached, an active proposal can proceed to the next state
without waiting for the proposal deadline.

<Callout>
The `timepoint` parameter corresponds to the snapshot used for counting the vote. This enables scaling of the
</Callout>
quorum depending on values such as the `totalSupply` of a token at this timepoint (see [`ERC20Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC20#ERC20Votes)).

<Callout>
Make sure the value specified for the super quorum is greater than [`GovernorUpgradeable.quorum`](#GovernorUpgradeable-quorum-uint256-), otherwise, it may be
</Callout>
possible to pass a proposal with less votes than the default quorum.

<a id="GovernorSuperQuorumUpgradeable-proposalVotes-uint256-"></a>

### `proposalVotes(uint256 proposalId) → uint256 againstVotes, uint256 forVotes, uint256 abstainVotes`
*public*

Accessor to the internal vote counts. This must be implemented by the counting module. Counting modules
that don't implement this function are incompatible with this module

<a id="GovernorSuperQuorumUpgradeable-state-uint256-"></a>

### `state(uint256 proposalId) → enum IGovernor.ProposalState`
*public*

Overridden version of the [`Governor.state`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-state) function that checks if the proposal has reached the super
quorum.

<Callout>
If the proposal reaches super quorum but [`GovernorUpgradeable._voteSucceeded`](#GovernorUpgradeable-_voteSucceeded-uint256-) returns false, eg, assuming the super quorum
</Callout>
has been set low enough that both FOR and AGAINST votes have exceeded it and AGAINST votes exceed FOR votes,
the proposal continues to be active until [`GovernorUpgradeable._voteSucceeded`](#GovernorUpgradeable-_voteSucceeded-uint256-) returns true or the proposal deadline is reached.
This means that with a low super quorum it is also possible that a vote can succeed prematurely before enough
AGAINST voters have a chance to vote. Hence, it is recommended to set a high enough super quorum to avoid these
types of scenarios.

## `GovernorTimelockAccessUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockAccessUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockAccessUpgradeable.sol";
```

This module connects a [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) instance to an [`AccessManager`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/access#AccessManager) instance, allowing the governor to make calls
that are delay-restricted by the manager using the normal [`GovernorUpgradeable.queue`](#GovernorUpgradeable-queue-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-) workflow. An optional base delay is applied to
operations that are not delayed externally by the manager. Execution of a proposal will be delayed as much as
necessary to meet the required delays of all of its operations.

This extension allows the governor to hold and use its own assets and permissions, unlike [`GovernorTimelockControl`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorTimelockControl)
and [`GovernorTimelockCompound`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorTimelockCompound), where the timelock is a separate contract that must be the one to hold assets and
permissions. Operations that are delay-restricted by the manager, however, will be executed through the
[`AccessManager.execute`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/access#AccessManager-execute) function.

==== Security Considerations

Some operations may be cancelable in the `AccessManager` by the admin or a set of guardians, depending on the
restricted function being invoked. Since proposals are atomic, the cancellation by a guardian of a single operation
in a proposal will cause all of the proposal to become unable to execute. Consider proposing cancellable operations
separately.

By default, function calls will be routed through the associated `AccessManager` whenever it claims the target
function to be restricted by it. However, admins may configure the manager to make that claim for functions that a
governor would want to call directly (e.g., token transfers) in an attempt to deny it access to those functions. To
mitigate this attack vector, the governor is able to ignore the restrictions claimed by the `AccessManager` using
[`GovernorTimelockAccessUpgradeable.setAccessManagerIgnored`](#GovernorTimelockAccessUpgradeable-setAccessManagerIgnored-address-bytes4---bool-). While permanent denial of service is mitigated, temporary DoS may still be technically
possible. All of the governor's own functions (e.g., [`GovernorTimelockAccessUpgradeable.setBaseDelaySeconds`](#GovernorTimelockAccessUpgradeable-setBaseDelaySeconds-uint32-)) ignore the `AccessManager` by default.

<Callout>
`AccessManager` does not support scheduling more than one operation with the same target and calldata at
</Callout>
the same time. See [`AccessManager.schedule`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/access#AccessManager-schedule) for a workaround.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable.sol";
```

Extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) that binds the execution process to a Compound Timelock. This adds a delay, enforced by
the external timelock to all successful proposals (in addition to the voting duration). The [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) needs to be
the admin of the timelock for any operation to be performed. A public, unrestricted,
[`GovernorTimelockCompound.__acceptAdmin`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorTimelockCompound-_acceptAdmin) is available to accept ownership of the timelock.

Using this model means the proposal will be operated by the [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController) and not by the [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor). Thus,
the assets and permissions must be attached to the [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController). Any asset sent to the [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) will be
inaccessible from a proposal, unless executed via [`Governor.relay`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-relay).

*internal*

<a id="GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable-state-uint256-"></a>

### `state(uint256 proposalId) → enum IGovernor.ProposalState`
*public*

Overridden version of the [`Governor.state`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-state) function with added support for the `Expired` state.

<a id="GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable-timelock--"></a>

### `timelock() → address`

### `_queueOperations(uint256 proposalId, address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32) → uint48`
*internal*

Function to queue a proposal to the timelock.

### `_executeOperations(uint256 proposalId, address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32)`
*internal*

Overridden version of the [`Governor._executeOperations`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-executeOperations) function that run the already queued proposal
through the timelock.

<a id="GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable-_cancel-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-"></a>

### `_cancel(address[] targets, uint256[] values, bytes[] calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) → uint256`
*internal*

Overridden version of the [`Governor._cancel`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-cancel) function to cancel the timelocked proposal if it has already
been queued.

<a id="GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable-_executor--"></a>

### `_executor() → address`
*internal*

Address through which the governor executes action. In this case, the timelock.

<a id="GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable-__acceptAdmin--"></a>

### `__acceptAdmin()`
*public*

Accept admin right over the timelock.

<a id="GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable-updateTimelock-contract-ICompoundTimelock-"></a>

### `updateTimelock(contract ICompoundTimelock newTimelock)`
*external*

Public endpoint to update the underlying timelock instance. Restricted to the timelock itself, so updates
must be proposed, scheduled, and executed through governance proposals.

For security reasons, the timelock must be handed over to another admin before setting up a new one. The two
operations (hand over the timelock) and do the update can be batched in a single proposal.

Note that if the timelock admin has been handed over in a previous operation, we refuse updates made through the
timelock if admin of the timelock has already been accepted and the operation is executed outside the scope of
governance.

<Callout type='warn'>
It is not recommended to change the timelock while there are other queued governance proposals.
</Callout>

<a id="GovernorTimelockCompoundUpgradeable-TimelockChange-address-address-"></a>

### `TimelockChange(address oldTimelock, address newTimelock)`
*event*

Emitted when the timelock controller used for proposal execution is modified.

<a id="GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable"></a>

## `GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable.sol";
```

Extension of [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) that binds the execution process to an instance of [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController). This adds a
delay, enforced by the [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController) to all successful proposal (in addition to the voting duration). The
[`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) needs the proposer (and ideally the executor and canceller) roles for the [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) to work properly.

Using this model means the proposal will be operated by the [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController) and not by the [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor). Thus,
the assets and permissions must be attached to the [`TimelockController`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController). Any asset sent to the [`Governor`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor) will be
inaccessible from a proposal, unless executed via [`Governor.relay`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-relay).

<Callout type='warn'>
Setting up the TimelockController to have additional proposers or cancelers besides the governor is very
</Callout>
risky, as it grants them the ability to: 1) execute operations as the timelock, and thus possibly performing
operations or accessing funds that are expected to only be accessible through a vote, and 2) block governance
proposals that have been approved by the voters, effectively executing a Denial of Service attack.

### `__GovernorVotesQuorumFraction_init(uint256 quorumNumeratorValue)`
*internal*

Initialize quorum as a fraction of the token's total supply.

The fraction is specified as `numerator / denominator`. By default the denominator is 100, so quorum is
specified as a percent: a numerator of 10 corresponds to quorum being 10% of total supply. The denominator can be
customized by overriding [`GovernorVotesQuorumFractionUpgradeable.quorumDenominator`](#GovernorVotesQuorumFractionUpgradeable-quorumDenominator--).

### `__GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFraction_init(uint256 superQuorumNumeratorValue)`
*internal*

Initialize super quorum as a fraction of the token's total supply.

The super quorum is specified as a fraction of the token's total supply and has to
be greater than the quorum.

Returns the super quorum numerator at a specific `timepoint`.

<a id="GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFractionUpgradeable-superQuorum-uint256-"></a>

### `superQuorum(uint256 timepoint) → uint256`
*public*

Returns the super quorum for a `timepoint`, in terms of number of votes: `supply * numerator / denominator`.
See [`GovernorSuperQuorum.superQuorum`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorSuperQuorum-superQuorum) for more details.

<a id="GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFractionUpgradeable-updateSuperQuorumNumerator-uint256-"></a>

### `updateSuperQuorumNumerator(uint256 newSuperQuorumNumerator)`
*public*

Changes the super quorum numerator.

Emits a [`SuperQuorumNumeratorUpdated`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#SuperQuorumNumeratorUpdated) event.

Requirements:

- Must be called through a governance proposal.
- New super quorum numerator must be smaller or equal to the denominator.
- New super quorum numerator must be greater than or equal to the quorum numerator.

Requirements:

- New super quorum numerator must be smaller or equal to the denominator.
- New super quorum numerator must be greater than or equal to the quorum numerator.

<a id="GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFractionUpgradeable-_updateQuorumNumerator-uint256-"></a>

### `_updateQuorumNumerator(uint256 newQuorumNumerator)`
*internal*

Overrides [`GovernorVotesQuorumFraction._updateQuorumNumerator`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#GovernorVotesQuorumFraction-updateQuorumNumerator) to ensure the super
quorum numerator is greater than or equal to the quorum numerator.

<a id="GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFractionUpgradeable-state-uint256-"></a>

### `state(uint256 proposalId) → enum IGovernor.ProposalState`
*public*

Overridden version of the [`Governor.state`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Governor-state) function that checks if the proposal has reached the super
quorum.

<Callout>
If the proposal reaches super quorum but [`GovernorUpgradeable._voteSucceeded`](#GovernorUpgradeable-_voteSucceeded-uint256-) returns false, eg, assuming the super quorum
</Callout>
has been set low enough that both FOR and AGAINST votes have exceeded it and AGAINST votes exceed FOR votes,
the proposal continues to be active until [`GovernorUpgradeable._voteSucceeded`](#GovernorUpgradeable-_voteSucceeded-uint256-) returns true or the proposal deadline is reached.
This means that with a low super quorum it is also possible that a vote can succeed prematurely before enough
AGAINST voters have a chance to vote. Hence, it is recommended to set a high enough super quorum to avoid these
types of scenarios.

```solidity

Extension of [`Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Votes) that adds checkpoints for delegations and balances.

<Callout type='warn'>
While this contract extends [`Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Votes), valid uses of [`Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#Votes) may not be compatible with
</Callout>
[`VotesExtended`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#VotesExtended) without additional considerations. This implementation of [`VotesExtendedUpgradeable._transferVotingUnits`](#VotesExtendedUpgradeable-_transferVotingUnits-address-address-uint256-) must
run AFTER the voting weight movement is registered, such that it is reflected on [`VotesUpgradeable._getVotingUnits`](#VotesUpgradeable-_getVotingUnits-address-).

Said differently, [`VotesExtended`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#VotesExtended) MUST be integrated in a way that calls [`VotesExtendedUpgradeable._transferVotingUnits`](#VotesExtendedUpgradeable-_transferVotingUnits-address-address-uint256-) AFTER the
asset transfer is registered and balances are updated:

```solidity

## `VotesUpgradeable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/governance/utils/VotesUpgradeable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/utils/VotesUpgradeable.sol";
```

This is a base abstract contract that tracks voting units, which are a measure of voting power that can be
transferred, and provides a system of vote delegation, where an account can delegate its voting units to a sort of
"representative" that will pool delegated voting units from different accounts and can then use it to vote in
decisions. In fact, voting units _must_ be delegated in order to count as actual votes, and an account has to
delegate those votes to itself if it wishes to participate in decisions and does not have a trusted representative.

This contract is often combined with a token contract such that voting units correspond to token units. For an
example, see [`ERC721Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC721#ERC721Votes).

The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed
at a particular block number to protect against flash loans and double voting. The opt-in delegate system makes the
cost of this history tracking optional.

When using this module the derived contract must implement [`VotesUpgradeable._getVotingUnits`](#VotesUpgradeable-_getVotingUnits-address-) (for example, make it return
[`ERC721.balanceOf`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC721#ERC721-balanceOf)), and can use [`VotesExtendedUpgradeable._transferVotingUnits`](#VotesExtendedUpgradeable-_transferVotingUnits-address-address-uint256-) to track a change in the distribution of those units (in the
previous example, it would be included in [`ERC721._update`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC721#ERC721-update)).
