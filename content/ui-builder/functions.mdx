title: Functions
---

Once you have provided your contract information you can choose which function you would like to build a form for. At the moment forms are limited to a single function. Since contract state is included by default only write functions are available for forms.

By using the information from the ABI the UI Builder will preview what functions are available and what the parameters are for each of them.



If you don’t see your function listed be sure to check the ABI and the original contract
