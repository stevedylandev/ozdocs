This directory includes primitives for on-chain governance.

## Governor

This modular system of Governor contracts allows the deployment on-chain voting protocols similar to [Compound’s Governor Alpha & Bravo](https://compound.finance/docs/governance) and beyond, through the ability to easily customize multiple aspects of the protocol.

<Callout>
For a guided experience, set up your Governor contract using [Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#governor).

For a written walkthrough, check out our guide on [How to set up on-chain governance](/contracts/4.x/governance).
</Callout>

* [`Governor`](#Governor): The core contract that contains all the logic and primitives. It is abstract and requires choosing one of each of the modules below, or custom ones.

Votes modules determine the source of voting power, and sometimes quorum number.

* [`GovernorVotes`](#GovernorVotes): Extracts voting weight from an [`ERC20Votes`](/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20Votes), or since v4.5 an [`ERC721Votes`](/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721Votes) token.
* [`GovernorVotesComp`](#GovernorVotesComp): Extracts voting weight from a COMP-like or [`ERC20VotesComp`](/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20VotesComp) token.
* [`GovernorVotesQuorumFraction`](#GovernorVotesQuorumFraction): Combines with `GovernorVotes` to set the quorum as a fraction of the total token supply.

Counting modules determine valid voting options.

* [`GovernorCountingSimple`](#GovernorCountingSimple): Simple voting mechanism with 3 voting options: Against, For and Abstain.

Timelock extensions add a delay for governance decisions to be executed. The workflow is extended to require a `queue` step before execution. With these modules, proposals are executed by the external timelock contract, thus it is the timelock that has to hold the assets that are being governed.

* [`GovernorTimelockControl`](#GovernorTimelockControl): Connects with an instance of [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController). Allows multiple proposers and executors, in addition to the Governor itself.
* [`GovernorTimelockCompound`](#GovernorTimelockCompound): Connects with an instance of Compound’s [`Timelock`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Timelock.sol) contract.

Other extensions can customize the behavior or interface in multiple ways.

* [`GovernorCompatibilityBravo`](#GovernorCompatibilityBravo): Extends the interface to be fully `GovernorBravo`-compatible. Note that events are compatible regardless of whether this extension is included or not.
* [`GovernorSettings`](#GovernorSettings): Manages some of the settings (voting delay, voting period duration, and proposal threshold) in a way that can be updated through a governance proposal, without requiring an upgrade.
* [`GovernorPreventLateQuorum`](#GovernorPreventLateQuorum): Ensures there is a minimum voting period after quorum is reached as a security protection against large voters.

In addition to modules and extensions, the core contract requires a few virtual functions to be implemented to your particular specifications:

* [`votingDelay()`](#Governor-votingDelay-): Delay (in EIP-6372 clock) since the proposal is submitted until voting power is fixed and voting starts. This can be used to enforce a delay after a proposal is published for users to buy tokens, or delegate their votes.
* [`votingPeriod()`](#Governor-votingPeriod-): Delay (in EIP-6372 clock) since the proposal starts until voting ends.
* [`quorum(uint256 timepoint)`](#Governor-quorum-uint256-): Quorum required for a proposal to be successful. This function includes a `timepoint` argument (see EIP-6372) so the quorum can adapt through time, for example, to follow a token’s `totalSupply`.

<Callout>
Functions of the `Governor` contract do not include access control. If you want to restrict access, you should add these checks by overloading the particular functions. Among these, [`Governor._cancel`](#Governor-_cancel-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-) is internal by default, and you will have to expose it (with the right access control mechanism) yourself if this function is needed.

## Timelock

In a governance system, the [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController) contract is in charge of introducing a delay between a proposal and its execution. It can be used with or without a [`Governor`](#Governor).

[`TimelockController`](#TimelockController)

#### Terminology

* **Operation:** A transaction (or a set of transactions) that is the subject of the timelock. It has to be scheduled by a proposer and executed by an executor. The timelock enforces a minimum delay between the proposition and the execution (see [operation lifecycle](/contracts/4.x/access-control#operation_lifecycle)). If the operation contains multiple transactions (batch mode), they are executed atomically. Operations are identified by the hash of their content.
* **Operation status:**
  * **Unset:** An operation that is not part of the timelock mechanism.
  * **Pending:** An operation that has been scheduled, before the timer expires.
  * **Ready:** An operation that has been scheduled, after the timer expires.
  * **Done:** An operation that has been executed.
* **Predecessor**: An (optional) dependency between operations. An operation can depend on another operation (its predecessor), forcing the execution order of these two operations.
* **Role**:
  * **Admin:** An address (smart contract or EOA) that is in charge of granting the roles of Proposer and Executor.
  * **Proposer:** An address (smart contract or EOA) that is in charge of scheduling (and cancelling) operations.
  * **Executor:** An address (smart contract or EOA) that is in charge of executing operations once the timelock has expired. This role can be given to the zero address to allow anyone to execute operations.

#### Operation structure

Operation executed by the [`TimelockController`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController) can contain one or multiple subsequent calls. Depending on whether you need to multiple calls to be executed atomically, you can either use simple or batched operations.

Both operations contain:

* **Target**, the address of the smart contract that the timelock should operate on.
* **Value**, in wei, that should be sent with the transaction. Most of the time this will be 0. Ether can be deposited before-end or passed along when executing the transaction.
* **Data**, containing the encoded function selector and parameters of the call. This can be produced using a number of tools. For example, a maintenance operation granting role `ROLE` to `ACCOUNT` can be encoded using web3js as follows:

```javascript
const data = timelock.contract.methods.grantRole(ROLE, ACCOUNT).encodeABI()
```

* **Predecessor**, that specifies a dependency between operations. This dependency is optional. Use `bytes32(0)` if the operation does not have any dependency.
* **Salt**, used to disambiguate two otherwise identical operations. This can be any random value.

In the case of batched operations, `target`, `value` and `data` are specified as arrays, which must be of the same length.

#### Operation lifecycle

Timelocked operations are identified by a unique id (their hash) and follow a specific lifecycle:

`Unset` -> `Pending` -> `Pending` + `Ready` -> `Done`

* By calling [`schedule`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-schedule-address-uint256-bytes-bytes32-bytes32-uint256-) (or [`scheduleBatch`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-scheduleBatch-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-bytes32-uint256-)), a proposer moves the operation from the `Unset` to the `Pending` state. This starts a timer that must be longer than the minimum delay. The timer expires at a timestamp accessible through the [`getTimestamp`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-getTimestamp-bytes32-) method.
* Once the timer expires, the operation automatically gets the `Ready` state. At this point, it can be executed.
* By calling [`execute`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-TimelockController-execute-address-uint256-bytes-bytes32-bytes32-) (or [`executeBatch`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-executeBatch-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-bytes32-)), an executor triggers the operation’s underlying transactions and moves it to the `Done` state. If the operation has a predecessor, it has to be in the `Done` state for this transition to succeed.
* [`cancel`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-TimelockController-cancel-bytes32-) allows proposers to cancel any `Pending` operation. This resets the operation to the `Unset` state. It is thus possible for a proposer to re-schedule an operation that has been cancelled. In this case, the timer restarts when the operation is re-scheduled.

Operations status can be queried using the functions:

* [`isOperationPending(bytes32)`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-isOperationPending-bytes32-)
* [`isOperationReady(bytes32)`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-isOperationReady-bytes32-)
* [`isOperationDone(bytes32)`](/contracts/4.x/api/governance#TimelockController-isOperationDone-bytes32-)

#### Roles

##### Admin

The admins are in charge of managing proposers and executors. For the timelock to be self-governed, this role should only be given to the timelock itself. Upon deployment, the admin role can be granted to any address (in addition to the timelock itself). After further configuration and testing, this optional admin should renounce its role such that all further maintenance operations have to go through the timelock process.

This role is identified by the **TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE** value: `0x5f58e3a2316349923ce3780f8d587db2d72378aed66a8261c916544fa6846ca5`

##### Proposer

The proposers are in charge of scheduling (and cancelling) operations. This is a critical role, that should be given to governing entities. This could be an EOA, a multisig, or a DAO.

<Callout type='warn'>
**Proposer fight:** Having multiple proposers, while providing redundancy in case one becomes unavailable, can be dangerous. As proposer have their say on all operations, they could cancel operations they disagree with, including operations to remove them for the proposers.
</Callout>

This role is identified by the **PROPOSER_ROLE** value: `0xb09aa5aeb3702cfd50b6b62bc4532604938f21248a27a1d5ca736082b6819cc1`

##### Executor

The executors are in charge of executing the operations scheduled by the proposers once the timelock expires. Logic dictates that multisig or DAO that are proposers should also be executors in order to guarantee operations that have been scheduled will eventually be executed. However, having additional executors can reduce the cost (the executing transaction does not require validation by the multisig or DAO that proposed it), while ensuring whoever is in charge of execution cannot trigger actions that have not been scheduled by the proposers. Alternatively, it is possible to allow _any_ address to execute a proposal once the timelock has expired by granting the executor role to the zero address.

This role is identified by the **EXECUTOR_ROLE** value: `0xd8aa0f3194971a2a116679f7c2090f6939c8d4e01a2a8d7e41d55e5351469e63`

<Callout type='warn'>
A live contract without at least one proposer and one executor is locked. Make sure these roles are filled by reliable entities before the deployer renounces its administrative rights in favour of the timelock contract itself. See the [`AccessControl`](/contracts/4.x/api/access#AccessControl) documentation to learn more about role management.

Core of the governance system, designed to be extended though various modules.

This contract is abstract and requires several functions to be implemented in various modules:

- A counting module must implement [`IGovernor.quorum`](#IGovernor-quorum-uint256-), [`Governor._quorumReached`](#Governor-_quorumReached-uint256-), [`Governor._voteSucceeded`](#Governor-_voteSucceeded-uint256-) and [`Governor._countVote`](#Governor-_countVote-uint256-address-uint8-uint256-bytes-)
- A voting module must implement [`Governor._getVotes`](#Governor-_getVotes-address-uint256-bytes-)
- Additionally, [`IGovernor.votingPeriod`](#IGovernor-votingPeriod--) must also be implemented

_Available since v4.3._

Restricts a function so it can only be executed through governance proposals. For example, governance
parameter setters in [`GovernorSettings`](#GovernorSettings) are protected using this modifier.

The governance executing address may be different from the Governor's own address, for example it could be a
timelock. This can be customized by modules by overriding [`Governor._executor`](#Governor-_executor--). The executor is only able to invoke these
functions during the execution of the governor's [`Governor.execute`](#Governor-execute-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-) function, and not under any other circumstances. Thus,
for example, additional timelock proposers are not able to change governance parameters without going through the
governance protocol (since v4.6).

See [`IGovernor.hashProposal`](#IGovernor-hashProposal-address---uint256---bytes---bytes32-).

The proposal id is produced by hashing the ABI encoded `targets` array, the `values` array, the `calldatas` array
and the descriptionHash (bytes32 which itself is the keccak256 hash of the description string). This proposal id
can be produced from the proposal data which is part of the [`IGovernor.ProposalCreated`](#IGovernor-ProposalCreated-uint256-address-address---uint256---string---bytes---uint256-uint256-string-) event. It can even be computed in
advance, before the proposal is submitted.

Note that the chainId and the governor address are not part of the proposal id computation. Consequently, the
same proposal (with same operation and same description) will have the same id if submitted on multiple governors
across multiple networks. This also means that in order to execute the same operation twice (on the same
governor) the proposer will have to change the description in order to avoid proposal id conflicts.

Check if the proposer is authorized to submit a proposal with the given description.

If the proposal description ends with `#proposer=0x???`, where `0x???` is an address written as a hex string
(case insensitive), then the submission of this proposal will only be authorized to said address.

This is used for frontrunning protection. By adding this pattern at the end of their proposal, one can ensure
that no other address can submit the same proposal. An attacker would have to either remove or change that part,
which would result in a different proposal id.

If the description does not match this pattern, it is unrestricted and anyone can submit it. This includes:
- If the `0x???` part is not a valid hex string.
- If the `0x???` part is a valid hex string, but does not contain exactly 40 hex digits.
- If it ends with the expected suffix followed by newlines or other whitespace.
- If it ends with some other similar suffix, e.g. `#other=abc`.
- If it does not end with any such suffix.

A description of the possible `support` values for [`Governor.castVote`](#Governor-castVote-uint256-uint8-) and the way these votes are counted, meant to
be consumed by UIs to show correct vote options and interpret the results. The string is a URL-encoded sequence of
key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

- `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.
- `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
- `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique
name that describes the behavior. For example:

- `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.
- `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

NOTE: The string can be decoded by the standard
[`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams)
JavaScript class.

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol";
```

Contract module which acts as a timelocked controller. When set as the
owner of an `Ownable` smart contract, it enforces a timelock on all
`onlyOwner` maintenance operations. This gives time for users of the
controlled contract to exit before a potentially dangerous maintenance
operation is applied.

By default, this contract is self administered, meaning administration tasks
have to go through the timelock process. The proposer (resp executor) role
is in charge of proposing (resp executing) operations. A common use case is
to position this [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController) as the owner of a smart contract, with
a multisig or a DAO as the sole proposer.

_Available since v3.3._

The optional admin can aid with initial configuration of roles after deployment

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/compatibility/GovernorCompatibilityBravo.sol";
```

Compatibility layer that implements GovernorBravo compatibility on top of [`Governor`](#Governor).

This compatibility layer includes a voting system and requires a [`IGovernorTimelock`](#IGovernorTimelock) compatible module to be added
through inheritance. It does not include token bindings, nor does it include any variable upgrade patterns.

NOTE: When using this module, you may need to enable the Solidity optimizer to avoid hitting the contract size limit.

_Available since v4.3._

A description of the possible `support` values for [`Governor.castVote`](#Governor-castVote-uint256-uint8-) and the way these votes are counted, meant to
be consumed by UIs to show correct vote options and interpret the results. The string is a URL-encoded sequence of
key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

- `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.
- `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
- `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique
name that describes the behavior. For example:

- `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.
- `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

NOTE: The string can be decoded by the standard
[`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams)
JavaScript class.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorPreventLateQuorum.sol";
```

A module that ensures there is a minimum voting period after quorum is reached. This prevents a large voter from
swaying a vote and triggering quorum at the last minute, by ensuring there is always time for other voters to react
and try to oppose the decision.

If a vote causes quorum to be reached, the proposal's voting period may be extended so that it does not end before at
least a specified time has passed (the "vote extension" parameter). This parameter can be set through a governance
proposal.

_Available since v4.5._

```

Extension of [`Governor`](#Governor) that binds the execution process to a Compound Timelock. This adds a delay, enforced by
the external timelock to all successful proposal (in addition to the voting duration). The [`Governor`](#Governor) needs to be
the admin of the timelock for any operation to be performed. A public, unrestricted,
[`GovernorTimelockCompound.__acceptAdmin`](#GovernorTimelockCompound-__acceptAdmin--) is available to accept ownership of the timelock.

Using this model means the proposal will be operated by the [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController) and not by the [`Governor`](#Governor). Thus,
the assets and permissions must be attached to the [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController). Any asset sent to the [`Governor`](#Governor) will be
inaccessible.

_Available since v4.3._

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockControl.sol";
```

Extension of [`Governor`](#Governor) that binds the execution process to an instance of [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController). This adds a
delay, enforced by the [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController) to all successful proposal (in addition to the voting duration). The
[`Governor`](#Governor) needs the proposer (and ideally the executor) roles for the [`Governor`](#Governor) to work properly.

Using this model means the proposal will be operated by the [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController) and not by the [`Governor`](#Governor). Thus,
the assets and permissions must be attached to the [`TimelockController`](#TimelockController). Any asset sent to the [`Governor`](#Governor) will be
inaccessible.

<Callout type="warn">
Setting up the TimelockController to have additional proposers besides the governor is very risky, as it
grants them powers that they must be trusted or known not to use: 1) [`Governor.onlyGovernance`](#Governor-onlyGovernance--) functions like [`Governor.relay`](#Governor-relay-address-uint256-bytes-) are
available to them through the timelock, and 2) approved governance proposals can be blocked by them, effectively
executing a Denial of Service attack. This risk will be mitigated in a future release.
</Callout>

_Available since v4.3._

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/utils/Votes.sol";
```

This is a base abstract contract that tracks voting units, which are a measure of voting power that can be
transferred, and provides a system of vote delegation, where an account can delegate its voting units to a sort of
"representative" that will pool delegated voting units from different accounts and can then use it to vote in
decisions. In fact, voting units _must_ be delegated in order to count as actual votes, and an account has to
delegate those votes to itself if it wishes to participate in decisions and does not have a trusted representative.

This contract is often combined with a token contract such that voting units correspond to token units. For an
example, see [`ERC721Votes`](/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721Votes).

The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed
at a particular block number to protect against flash loans and double voting. The opt-in delegate system makes the
cost of this history tracking optional.

When using this module the derived contract must implement [`Votes._getVotingUnits`](#Votes-_getVotingUnits-address-) (for example, make it return
[`ERC721.balanceOf`](/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721-balanceOf-address-)), and can use [`Votes._transferVotingUnits`](#Votes-_transferVotingUnits-address-address-uint256-) to track a change in the distribution of those units (in the
previous example, it would be included in [`ERC721._beforeTokenTransfer`](/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721-_beforeTokenTransfer-address-address-uint256-uint256-)).
