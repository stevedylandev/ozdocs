## Introspection

This set of interfaces and contracts deal with [type introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection) of contracts, that is, examining which functions can be called on them. This is usually referred to as a contract’s _interface_.

Ethereum contracts have no native concept of an interface, so applications must usually simply trust they are not making an incorrect call. For trusted setups this is a non-issue, but often unknown and untrusted third-party addresses need to be interacted with. There may even not be any direct calls to them! (e.g. ERC-20 tokens may be sent to a contract that lacks a way to transfer them out of it, locking them forever). In these cases, a contract _declaring_ its interface can be very helpful in preventing errors.

<a id="Address"></a>

## `Address` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Address.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";
```

Collection of functions related to the address type

### Functions
- [sendValue(recipient, amount)](#Address-sendValue-address-payable-uint256-)
- [functionCall(target, data)](#Address-functionCall-address-bytes-)
- [functionCallWithValue(target, data, value)](#Address-functionCallWithValue-address-bytes-uint256-)
- [functionStaticCall(target, data)](#Address-functionStaticCall-address-bytes-)
- [functionDelegateCall(target, data)](#Address-functionDelegateCall-address-bytes-)
- [verifyCallResultFromTarget(target, success, returndata)](#Address-verifyCallResultFromTarget-address-bool-bytes-)
- [verifyCallResult(success, returndata)](#Address-verifyCallResult-bool-bytes-)

### Errors
- [AddressEmptyCode(target)](#Address-AddressEmptyCode-address-)

<a id="Address-sendValue-address-payable-uint256-"></a>

### `sendValue(address payable recipient, uint256 amount)`
*internal*

Replacement for Solidity's `transfer`: sends `amount` wei to
`recipient`, forwarding all available gas and reverting on errors.

[EIP1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) increases the gas cost
of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit
imposed by `transfer`, making them unable to receive funds via
`transfer`. [`Address.sendValue`](#Address-sendValue-address-payable-uint256-) removes this limitation.

[Learn more](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/).

IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be
taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using
[`ReentrancyGuard`](#ReentrancyGuard) or the
[checks-effects-interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.20/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern).

<a id="Address-functionCall-address-bytes-"></a>

### `functionCall(address target, bytes data) → bytes`
*internal*

Performs a Solidity function call using a low level `call`. A
plain `call` is an unsafe replacement for a function call: use this
function instead.

If `target` reverts with a revert reason or custom error, it is bubbled
up by this function (like regular Solidity function calls). However, if
the call reverted with no returned reason, this function reverts with a
[`Errors.FailedCall`](#Errors-FailedCall--) error.

Returns the raw returned data. To convert to the expected return value,
use [`abi.decode`](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=abi.decode#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions).

Requirements:

- `target` must be a contract.
- calling `target` with `data` must not revert.

<a id="Address-functionCallWithValue-address-bytes-uint256-"></a>

### `functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes data, uint256 value) → bytes`
*internal*

Same as [`functionCall`](#Address-functionCall-address-bytes-),
but also transferring `value` wei to `target`.

Requirements:

- the calling contract must have an ETH balance of at least `value`.
- the called Solidity function must be `payable`.

<a id="Address-functionStaticCall-address-bytes-"></a>

### `functionStaticCall(address target, bytes data) → bytes`
*internal*

Same as [`functionCall`](#Address-functionCall-address-bytes-),
but performing a static call.

<a id="Address-functionDelegateCall-address-bytes-"></a>

### `functionDelegateCall(address target, bytes data) → bytes`
*internal*

Same as [`functionCall`](#Address-functionCall-address-bytes-),
but performing a delegate call.

<a id="Address-verifyCallResultFromTarget-address-bool-bytes-"></a>

### `verifyCallResultFromTarget(address target, bool success, bytes returndata) → bytes`
*internal*

Tool to verify that a low level call to smart-contract was successful, and reverts if the target
was not a contract or bubbling up the revert reason (falling back to [`Errors.FailedCall`](#Errors-FailedCall--)) in case
of an unsuccessful call.

<a id="Address-verifyCallResult-bool-bytes-"></a>

### `verifyCallResult(bool success, bytes returndata) → bytes`
*internal*

Tool to verify that a low level call was successful, and reverts if it wasn't, either by bubbling the
revert reason or with a default [`Errors.FailedCall`](#Errors-FailedCall--) error.

<a id="Address-AddressEmptyCode-address-"></a>

### `AddressEmptyCode(address target)`
*error*

There's no code at `target` (it is not a contract).

<a id="Arrays"></a>

## `Arrays` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Arrays.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Arrays.sol";
```

<a id="Arrays-sort-uint256---function--uint256-uint256--pure-returns--bool--"></a>

### `sort(uint256[] array, function (uint256,uint256) pure returns (bool) comp) → uint256[]`
*internal*

Sort an array of uint256 (in memory) following the provided comparator function.

This function does the sorting "in place", meaning that it overrides the input. The object is returned for
convenience, but that returned value can be discarded safely if the caller has a memory pointer to the array.

NOTE: this function's cost is `O(n · log(n))` in average and `O(n²)` in the worst case, with n the length of the
array. Using it in view functions that are executed through `eth_call` is safe, but one should be very careful
when executing this as part of a transaction. If the array being sorted is too large, the sort operation may
consume more gas than is available in a block, leading to potential DoS.

IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom comparator functions that access memory in an unsafe way.

<a id="Arrays-sort-uint256---"></a>

### `sort(uint256[] array) → uint256[]`
*internal*

Variant of [`Arrays.sort`](#Arrays-sort-bytes32---) that sorts an array of uint256 in increasing order.

<a id="Arrays-sort-address---function--address-address--pure-returns--bool--"></a>

### `sort(address[] array, function (address,address) pure returns (bool) comp) → address[]`
*internal*

Sort an array of address (in memory) following the provided comparator function.

This function does the sorting "in place", meaning that it overrides the input. The object is returned for
convenience, but that returned value can be discarded safely if the caller has a memory pointer to the array.

NOTE: this function's cost is `O(n · log(n))` in average and `O(n²)` in the worst case, with n the length of the
array. Using it in view functions that are executed through `eth_call` is safe, but one should be very careful
when executing this as part of a transaction. If the array being sorted is too large, the sort operation may
consume more gas than is available in a block, leading to potential DoS.

IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom comparator functions that access memory in an unsafe way.

<a id="Arrays-sort-address---"></a>

### `sort(address[] array) → address[]`
*internal*

Variant of [`Arrays.sort`](#Arrays-sort-bytes32---) that sorts an array of address in increasing order.

<a id="Arrays-sort-bytes32---function--bytes32-bytes32--pure-returns--bool--"></a>

### `sort(bytes32[] array, function (bytes32,bytes32) pure returns (bool) comp) → bytes32[]`
*internal*

Sort an array of bytes32 (in memory) following the provided comparator function.

This function does the sorting "in place", meaning that it overrides the input. The object is returned for
convenience, but that returned value can be discarded safely if the caller has a memory pointer to the array.

NOTE: this function's cost is `O(n · log(n))` in average and `O(n²)` in the worst case, with n the length of the
array. Using it in view functions that are executed through `eth_call` is safe, but one should be very careful
when executing this as part of a transaction. If the array being sorted is too large, the sort operation may
consume more gas than is available in a block, leading to potential DoS.

IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom comparator functions that access memory in an unsafe way.

<a id="Arrays-sort-bytes32---"></a>

### `sort(bytes32[] array) → bytes32[]`
*internal*

Variant of [`Arrays.sort`](#Arrays-sort-bytes32---) that sorts an array of bytes32 in increasing order.

<a id="Arrays-findUpperBound-uint256---uint256-"></a>

### `findUpperBound(uint256[] array, uint256 element) → uint256`
*internal*

Searches a sorted `array` and returns the first index that contains
a value greater or equal to `element`. If no such index exists (i.e. all
values in the array are strictly less than `element`), the array length is
returned. Time complexity O(log n).

NOTE: The `array` is expected to be sorted in ascending order, and to
contain no repeated elements.

IMPORTANT: Deprecated. This implementation behaves as [`Arrays.lowerBound`](#Arrays-lowerBound-uint256---uint256-) but lacks
support for repeated elements in the array. The [`Arrays.lowerBound`](#Arrays-lowerBound-uint256---uint256-) function should
be used instead.

### `lowerBound(uint256[] array, uint256 element) → uint256`
*internal*

<a id="Base64"></a>

## `Base64` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Base64.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Base64.sol";
```

Provides a set of functions to operate with Base64 strings.

### Functions
- [encode(data)](#Base64-encode-bytes-)
- [encodeURL(data)](#Base64-encodeURL-bytes-)

<a id="Base64-encode-bytes-"></a>

### `encode(bytes data) → string`
*internal*

Converts a `bytes` to its Bytes64 `string` representation.

<a id="Base64-encodeURL-bytes-"></a>

### `encodeURL(bytes data) → string`
*internal*

Converts a `bytes` to its Bytes64Url `string` representation.
Output is not padded with `=` as specified in [rfc4648](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648).

<a id="Blockhash"></a>

## `Blockhash` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Blockhash.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Blockhash.sol";
```

Library for accessing historical block hashes beyond the standard 256 block limit.
Uses EIP-2935's history storage contract which maintains a ring buffer of the last
8191 block hashes in state.

For blocks within the last 256 blocks, it uses the native `BLOCKHASH` opcode.
For blocks between 257 and 8191 blocks ago, it queries the EIP-2935 history storage.
For blocks older than 8191 or future blocks, it returns zero, matching the `BLOCKHASH` behavior.

NOTE: After EIP-2935 activation, it takes 8191 blocks to completely fill the history.
Before that, only block hashes since the fork block will be available.

### Functions
- [blockHash(blockNumber)](#Blockhash-blockHash-uint256-)

<a id="Blockhash-blockHash-uint256-"></a>

### `blockHash(uint256 blockNumber) → bytes32`
*internal*

Retrieves the block hash for any historical block within the supported range.

NOTE: The function gracefully handles future blocks and blocks beyond the history window
by returning zero, consistent with the EVM's native `BLOCKHASH` behavior.

<a id="Bytes"></a>

## `Bytes` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Bytes.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Bytes.sol";
```

Bytes operations.

### Functions
- [indexOf(buffer, s)](#Bytes-indexOf-bytes-bytes1-)

## `CAIP10` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/CAIP10.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/CAIP10.sol";
```

Helper library to format and parse CAIP-10 identifiers

[CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) defines account identifiers as:
account_id:        chain_id + ":" + account_address
chain_id:          [-a-z0-9]3,8:[-_a-zA-Z0-9]1,32 (See [`CAIP2`](#CAIP2))
account_address:   [-.%a-zA-Z0-9]1,128

WARNING: According to [CAIP-10's canonicalization section](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md#canonicalization),
the implementation remains at the developer's discretion. Please note that case variations may introduce ambiguity.
For example, when building hashes to identify accounts or data associated to them, multiple representations of the
same account would derive to different hashes. For EVM chains, we recommend using checksummed addresses for the
"account_address" part. They can be generated onchain using [`Strings.toChecksumHexString`](#Strings-toChecksumHexString-address-).

### Functions
- [local(account)](#CAIP10-local-address-)
- [format(caip2, account)](#CAIP10-format-string-string-)

NOTE: This function does not verify that the inputs are properly formatted.

<a id="CAIP10-parse-string-"></a>

### `parse(string caip10) → string caip2, string account`
*internal*

Parse a CAIP-10 identifier into its components.

NOTE: This function does not verify that the CAIP-10 input is properly formatted. The `caip2` return can be
parsed using the [`CAIP2`](#CAIP2) library.

Helper library to format and parse CAIP-2 identifiers

[CAIP-2](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-2.md) defines chain identifiers as:
chain_id:    namespace + ":" + reference
namespace:   [-a-z0-9]3,8
reference:   [-_a-zA-Z0-9]1,32

WARNING: In some cases, multiple CAIP-2 identifiers may all be valid representation of a single chain.
For EVM chains, it is recommended to use `eip155:xxx` as the canonical representation (where `xxx` is
the EIP-155 chain id). Consider the possible ambiguity when processing CAIP-2 identifiers or when using them
in the context of hashes.

## `Context` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Context.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol";
```

Provides information about the current execution context, including the
sender of the transaction and its data. While these are generally available
via msg.sender and msg.data, they should not be accessed in such a direct
manner, since when dealing with meta-transactions the account sending and
paying for execution may not be the actual sender (as far as an application
is concerned).

This contract is only required for intermediate, library-like contracts.

## `Create2` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Create2.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Create2.sol";
```

Helper to make usage of the `CREATE2` EVM opcode easier and safer.
`CREATE2` can be used to compute in advance the address where a smart
contract will be deployed, which allows for interesting new mechanisms known
as 'counterfactual interactions'.

See the [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014#motivation) for more
information.

### Functions
- [deploy(amount, salt, bytecode)](#Create2-deploy-uint256-bytes32-bytes-)

<a id="Create2-deploy-uint256-bytes32-bytes-"></a>

### `deploy(uint256 amount, bytes32 salt, bytes bytecode) → address addr`
*internal*

Deploys a contract using `CREATE2`. The address where the contract
will be deployed can be known in advance via [`Create2.computeAddress`](#Create2-computeAddress-bytes32-bytes32-address-).

The bytecode for a contract can be obtained from Solidity with
`type(contractName).creationCode`.

Requirements:

- `bytecode` must not be empty.
- `salt` must have not been used for `bytecode` already.
- the factory must have a balance of at least `amount`.
- if `amount` is non-zero, `bytecode` must have a `payable` constructor.

<a id="Create2-computeAddress-bytes32-bytes32-"></a>

### `computeAddress(bytes32 salt, bytes32 bytecodeHash) → address`
*internal*

Returns the address where a contract will be stored if deployed via [`Create2.deploy`](#Create2-deploy-uint256-bytes32-bytes-). Any change in the
`bytecodeHash` or `salt` will result in a new destination address.

<a id="Create2-computeAddress-bytes32-bytes32-address-"></a>

### `computeAddress(bytes32 salt, bytes32 bytecodeHash, address deployer) → address addr`
*internal*

Returns the address where a contract will be stored if deployed via [`Create2.deploy`](#Create2-deploy-uint256-bytes32-bytes-) from a contract located at
`deployer`. If `deployer` is this contract's address, returns the same value as [`Create2.computeAddress`](#Create2-computeAddress-bytes32-bytes32-address-).

<a id="Create2-Create2EmptyBytecode--"></a>

### `Create2EmptyBytecode()`
*error*

There's no code to deploy.

```

Collection of common custom errors used in multiple contracts

IMPORTANT: Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed in future versions of the library.
It is recommended to avoid relying on the error API for critical functionality.

_Available since v5.1._

### Errors
- [InsufficientBalance(balance, needed)](#Errors-InsufficientBalance-uint256-uint256-)
- [FailedCall()](#Errors-FailedCall--)
- [FailedDeployment()](#Errors-FailedDeployment--)
- [MissingPrecompile()](#Errors-MissingPrecompile-address-)

<a id="Errors-InsufficientBalance-uint256-uint256-"></a>

### `InsufficientBalance(uint256 balance, uint256 needed)`
*error*

The ETH balance of the account is not enough to perform the operation.

<a id="Errors-FailedCall--"></a>

### `FailedCall()`
*error*

A call to an address target failed. The target may have reverted.

<a id="Errors-FailedDeployment--"></a>

### `FailedDeployment()`
*error*

The deployment failed.

<a id="Errors-MissingPrecompile-address-"></a>

### `MissingPrecompile(address)`

<a id="Memory"></a>

## `Memory` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Memory.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Memory.sol";
```

Utilities to manipulate memory.

Memory is a contiguous and dynamic byte array in which Solidity stores non-primitive types.
This library provides functions to manipulate pointers to this dynamic array.

WARNING: When manipulating memory, make sure to follow the Solidity documentation
guidelines for [Memory Safety](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/assembly.html#memory-safety).

### Functions
- [getFreeMemoryPointer()](#Memory-getFreeMemoryPointer--)
- [setFreeMemoryPointer(ptr)](#Memory-setFreeMemoryPointer-Memory-Pointer-)
- [asBytes32(ptr)](#Memory-asBytes32-Memory-Pointer-)
- [asPointer(value)](#Memory-asPointer-bytes32-)

<a id="Memory-getFreeMemoryPointer--"></a>

### `getFreeMemoryPointer() → Memory.Pointer ptr`
*internal*

Returns a `Pointer` to the current free `Pointer`.

<a id="Memory-setFreeMemoryPointer-Memory-Pointer-"></a>

### `setFreeMemoryPointer(Memory.Pointer ptr)`
*internal*

Sets the free `Pointer` to a specific value.

WARNING: Everything after the pointer may be overwritten.

<a id="Memory-asBytes32-Memory-Pointer-"></a>

### `asBytes32(Memory.Pointer ptr) → bytes32`
*internal*

`Pointer` to `bytes32`. Expects a pointer to a properly ABI-encoded `bytes` object.

<a id="Memory-asPointer-bytes32-"></a>

### `asPointer(bytes32 value) → Memory.Pointer`
*internal*

`bytes32` to `Pointer`. Expects a pointer to a properly ABI-encoded `bytes` object.

<a id="Multicall"></a>

## `Multicall` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Multicall.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Multicall.sol";
```

Provides a function to batch together multiple calls in a single external call.

Consider any assumption about calldata validation performed by the sender may be violated if it's not especially
careful about sending transactions invoking [`Multicall.multicall`](#Multicall-multicall-bytes---). For example, a relay address that filters function
selectors won't filter calls nested within a [`Multicall.multicall`](#Multicall-multicall-bytes---) operation.

NOTE: Since 5.0.1 and 4.9.4, this contract identifies non-canonical contexts (i.e. `msg.sender` is not [`Context._msgSender`](#Context-_msgSender--)).
If a non-canonical context is identified, the following self `delegatecall` appends the last bytes of `msg.data`
to the subcall. This makes it safe to use with [`ERC2771Context`](metatx#ERC2771Context). Contexts that don't affect the resolution of
[`Context._msgSender`](#Context-_msgSender--) are not propagated to subcalls.

### Functions
- [multicall(data)](#Multicall-multicall-bytes---)

<a id="Multicall-multicall-bytes---"></a>

### `multicall(bytes[] data) → bytes[] results`
*external*

Receives and executes a batch of function calls on this contract.

<a id="Nonces"></a>

## `Nonces` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Nonces.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Nonces.sol";
```

Provides tracking nonces for addresses. Nonces will only increment.

### Functions
- [nonces(owner)](#Nonces-nonces-address-)
- [_useNonce(owner)](#Nonces-_useNonce-address-)
- [_useCheckedNonce(owner, nonce)](#Nonces-_useCheckedNonce-address-uint256-)

### Errors
- [InvalidAccountNonce(account, currentNonce)](#Nonces-InvalidAccountNonce-address-uint256-)

<a id="Nonces-nonces-address-"></a>

### `nonces(address owner) → uint256`
*public*

Returns the next unused nonce for an address.

<a id="Nonces-_useNonce-address-"></a>

### `_useNonce(address owner) → uint256`
*internal*

Consumes a nonce.

Returns the current value and increments nonce.

<a id="Nonces-_useCheckedNonce-address-uint256-"></a>

### `_useCheckedNonce(address owner, uint256 nonce)`
*internal*

Same as [`Nonces._useNonce`](#Nonces-_useNonce-address-) but checking that `nonce` is the next valid for `owner`.

<a id="Nonces-InvalidAccountNonce-address-uint256-"></a>

### `InvalidAccountNonce(address account, uint256 currentNonce)`
*error*

The nonce used for an `account` is not the expected current nonce.

<a id="NoncesKeyed"></a>

## `NoncesKeyed` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/NoncesKeyed.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/NoncesKeyed.sol";
```

Alternative to [`Nonces`](#Nonces), that supports key-ed nonces.

Follows the [ERC-4337's semi-abstracted nonce system](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#semi-abstracted-nonce-support).

NOTE: This contract inherits from [`Nonces`](#Nonces) and reuses its storage for the first nonce key (i.e. `0`). This
makes upgrading from [`Nonces`](#Nonces) to [`NoncesKeyed`](#NoncesKeyed) safe when using their upgradeable versions (e.g. `NoncesKeyedUpgradeable`).
Doing so will NOT reset the current state of nonces, avoiding replay attacks where a nonce is reused after the upgrade.

### Functions
- [nonces(owner, key)](#NoncesKeyed-nonces-address-uint192-)
- [_useNonce(owner, key)](#NoncesKeyed-_useNonce-address-uint192-)
- [_useCheckedNonce(owner, keyNonce)](#NoncesKeyed-_useCheckedNonce-address-uint256-)
- [_useCheckedNonce(owner, key, nonce)](#NoncesKeyed-_useCheckedNonce-address-uint192-uint64-)

#### Nonces

- [_useNonce(owner)](#Nonces-_useNonce-address-)

### Errors

#### Nonces
- [InvalidAccountNonce(account, currentNonce)](#Nonces-InvalidAccountNonce-address-uint256-)

<a id="NoncesKeyed-nonces-address-uint192-"></a>

### `nonces(address owner, uint192 key) → uint256`
*public*

Returns the next unused nonce for an address and key. Result contains the key prefix.

<a id="NoncesKeyed-_useNonce-address-uint192-"></a>

### `_useNonce(address owner, uint192 key) → uint256`
*internal*

Consumes the next unused nonce for an address and key.

Returns the current value without the key prefix. Consumed nonce is increased, so calling this function twice
with the same arguments will return different (sequential) results.

<a id="NoncesKeyed-_useCheckedNonce-address-uint256-"></a>

### `_useCheckedNonce(address owner, uint256 keyNonce)`
*internal*

Same as [`Nonces._useNonce`](#Nonces-_useNonce-address-) but checking that `nonce` is the next valid for `owner`.

This version takes the key and the nonce in a single uint256 parameter:
- use the first 24 bytes for the key
- use the last 8 bytes for the nonce

<a id="NoncesKeyed-_useCheckedNonce-address-uint192-uint64-"></a>

### `_useCheckedNonce(address owner, uint192 key, uint64 nonce)`
*internal*

Same as [`Nonces._useNonce`](#Nonces-_useNonce-address-) but checking that `nonce` is the next valid for `owner`.

This version takes the key and the nonce as two different parameters.

## `Pausable` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol";
```

Contract module which allows children to implement an emergency stop
mechanism that can be triggered by an authorized account.

This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the
modifiers `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused`, which can be applied to
the functions of your contract. Note that they will not be pausable by
simply including this module, only once the modifiers are put in place.

### Modifiers
- [whenNotPaused()](#Pausable-whenNotPaused--)
- [whenPaused()](#Pausable-whenPaused--)

### Functions

<a id="Pausable-_requireNotPaused--"></a>

### `_requireNotPaused()`
*internal*

Throws if the contract is paused.

<a id="Pausable-_requirePaused--"></a>

### `_requirePaused()`
*internal*

Throws if the contract is not paused.

<a id="Pausable-_pause--"></a>

### `_pause()`
*internal*

Triggers stopped state.

Requirements:

- The contract must not be paused.

<a id="Pausable-_unpause--"></a>

### `_unpause()`
*internal*

Returns to normal state.

Requirements:

- The contract must be paused.

<a id="Pausable-Paused-address-"></a>

### `Paused(address account)`
*event*

Emitted when the pause is triggered by `account`.

<a id="Pausable-Unpaused-address-"></a>

### `Unpaused(address account)`
*event*

Emitted when the pause is lifted by `account`.

<a id="Pausable-EnforcedPause--"></a>

<a id="ReentrancyGuard"></a>

## `ReentrancyGuard` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
```

Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.

Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the [`ReentrancyGuard.nonReentrant`](#ReentrancyGuard-nonReentrant--) modifier
available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
(reentrant) calls to them.

Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as
`nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
points to them.

TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,
consider using [`ReentrancyGuardTransient`](#ReentrancyGuardTransient) instead.

TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
to protect against it, check out our blog post
[Reentrancy After Istanbul](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/).

### Modifiers
- [nonReentrant()](#ReentrancyGuard-nonReentrant--)

### Errors
- [ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall()](#ReentrancyGuard-ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall--)

<a id="ReentrancyGuard-nonReentrant--"></a>

### `nonReentrant()`

Prevents a contract from calling itself, directly or indirectly.
Calling a `nonReentrant` function from another `nonReentrant`
function is not supported. It is possible to prevent this from happening
by making the `nonReentrant` function external, and making it call a
`private` function that does the actual work.

<a id="ReentrancyGuard-constructor--"></a>

### `constructor()`
*internal*

<a id="ReentrancyGuard-_reentrancyGuardEntered--"></a>

### `_reentrancyGuardEntered() → bool`
*internal*

Returns true if the reentrancy guard is currently set to "entered", which indicates there is a
`nonReentrant` function in the call stack.

<a id="ReentrancyGuard-ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall--"></a>

### `ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall()`
*error*

Unauthorized reentrant call.

## `ShortStrings` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol";
```

This library provides functions to convert short memory strings
into a `ShortString` type that can be used as an immutable variable.

Strings of arbitrary length can be optimized using this library if
they are short enough (up to 31 bytes) by packing them with their
length (1 byte) in a single EVM word (32 bytes). Additionally, a
fallback mechanism can be used for every other case.

Usage example:

```solidity
contract Named {
    using ShortStrings for *;

    ShortString private immutable _name;
    string private _nameFallback;

    constructor(string memory contractName) {
        _name = contractName.toShortStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);
    }

    function name() external view returns (string memory) {
        return _name.toStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);
    }
}
```

### Functions
- [toShortString(str)](#ShortStrings-toShortString-string-)
- [toString(sstr)](#ShortStrings-toString-ShortString-)
- [byteLength(sstr)](#ShortStrings-byteLength-ShortString-)
- [toShortStringWithFallback(value, store)](#ShortStrings-toShortStringWithFallback-string-string-)
- [toStringWithFallback(value, store)](#ShortStrings-toStringWithFallback-ShortString-string-)
- [byteLengthWithFallback(value, store)](#ShortStrings-byteLengthWithFallback-ShortString-string-)

## `SlotDerivation` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/SlotDerivation.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/SlotDerivation.sol";
```

Library for computing storage (and transient storage) locations from namespaces and deriving slots
corresponding to standard patterns. The derivation method for array and mapping matches the storage layout used by
the solidity language / compiler.

See [Solidity docs for mappings and dynamic arrays.](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/internals/layout_in_storage.html#mappings-and-dynamic-arrays).

Example usage:
```solidity
contract Example {
    // Add the library methods
    using StorageSlot for bytes32;
    using SlotDerivation for bytes32;

    // Declare a namespace
    string private constant _NAMESPACE = "<namespace>"; // eg. OpenZeppelin.Slot

    function setValueInNamespace(uint256 key, address newValue) internal {
        _NAMESPACE.erc7201Slot().deriveMapping(key).getAddressSlot().value = newValue;
    }

    function getValueInNamespace(uint256 key) internal view returns (address) {
        return _NAMESPACE.erc7201Slot().deriveMapping(key).getAddressSlot().value;
    }
}
```

TIP: Consider using this library along with [`StorageSlot`](#StorageSlot).

NOTE: This library provides a way to manipulate storage locations in a non-standard way. Tooling for checking
upgrade safety will ignore the slots accessed through this library.

_Available since v5.1._

## `StorageSlot` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol";
```

Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.

Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.
This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.

The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.

Example usage to set ERC-1967 implementation slot:
```solidity
contract ERC1967 {
    // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.
    bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;

    function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {
        return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;
    }

    function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
        require(newImplementation.code.length > 0);
        StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
    }
}
```

## `TransientSlot` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/TransientSlot.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/TransientSlot.sol";
```

Library for reading and writing value-types to specific transient storage slots.

Transient slots are often used to store temporary values that are removed after the current transaction.
This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.

 * Example reading and writing values using transient storage:
```solidity
contract Lock {
    using TransientSlot for *;

    // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.
    bytes32 internal constant _LOCK_SLOT = 0xf4678858b2b588224636b8522b729e7722d32fc491da849ed75b3fdf3c84f542;

    modifier locked() {
        require(!_LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tload());

        _LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tstore(true);
        _;
        _LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tstore(false);
    }
}
```

TIP: Consider using this library along with [`SlotDerivation`](#SlotDerivation).

Note that these functions return the actual result of the query: they do not
`revert` if an interface is not supported. It is up to the caller to decide
what to do in these cases.

### Functions
- [supportsERC165(account)](#ERC165Checker-supportsERC165-address-)
- [supportsInterface(account, interfaceId)](#ERC165Checker-supportsInterface-address-bytes4-)
- [getSupportedInterfaces(account, interfaceIds)](#ERC165Checker-getSupportedInterfaces-address-bytes4---)
- [supportsAllInterfaces(account, interfaceIds)](#ERC165Checker-supportsAllInterfaces-address-bytes4---)

### `supportsERC165(address account) → bool`
*internal*

Returns true if `account` supports the [`IERC165`](#IERC165) interface.

<a id="ERC165Checker-supportsInterface-address-bytes4-"></a>

### `supportsInterface(address account, bytes4 interfaceId) → bool`
*internal*

Returns true if `account` supports the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. Support for [`IERC165`](#IERC165) itself is queried automatically.

See [`IERC165.supportsInterface`](#IERC165-supportsInterface-bytes4-).

<a id="ERC165Checker-getSupportedInterfaces-address-bytes4---"></a>

### `getSupportedInterfaces(address account, bytes4[] interfaceIds) → bool[]`
*internal*

Returns a boolean array where each value corresponds to the
interfaces passed in and whether they're supported or not. This allows
you to batch check interfaces for a contract where your expectation
is that some interfaces may not be supported.

See [`IERC165.supportsInterface`](#IERC165-supportsInterface-bytes4-).

<a id="ERC165Checker-supportsAllInterfaces-address-bytes4---"></a>

### `supportsAllInterfaces(address account, bytes4[] interfaceIds) → bool`
*internal*

Returns true if `account` supports all the interfaces defined in
`interfaceIds`. Support for [`IERC165`](#IERC165) itself is queried automatically.

Batch-querying can lead to gas savings by skipping repeated checks for
[`IERC165`](#IERC165) support.

See [`IERC165.supportsInterface`](#IERC165-supportsInterface-bytes4-).

<a id="ERC165Checker-supportsERC165InterfaceUnchecked-address-bytes4-"></a>

### `supportsERC165InterfaceUnchecked(address account, bytes4 interfaceId) → bool`
*internal*

Assumes that account contains a contract that supports ERC-165, otherwise
the behavior of this method is undefined. This precondition can be checked
with [`ERC165Checker.supportsERC165`](#ERC165Checker-supportsERC165-address-).

Some precompiled contracts will falsely indicate support for a given interface, so caution
should be exercised when using this function.

Interface identification is specified in ERC-165.

<a id="Math-mulShr-uint256-uint256-uint8-"></a>

### `mulShr(uint256 x, uint256 y, uint8 n) → uint256 result`
*internal*

Calculates floor(x * y >> n) with full precision. Throws if result overflows a uint256.

<a id="Math-mulShr-uint256-uint256-uint8-enum-Math-Rounding-"></a>

<a id="Math-invMod-uint256-uint256-"></a>

### `invMod(uint256 a, uint256 n) → uint256`
*internal*

Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.

If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.
If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.

If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.

NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the
inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`. See [`Math.invModPrime`](#Math-invModPrime-uint256-uint256-).

<a id="Math-invModPrime-uint256-uint256-"></a>

### `invModPrime(uint256 a, uint256 p) → uint256`
*internal*

Variant of [`Math.invMod`](#Math-invMod-uint256-uint256-). More efficient, but only works if `p` is known to be a prime greater than `2`.

From [Fermat's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem), we know that if p is
prime, then `a**(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p`. As a consequence, we have `a * a**(p-2) ≡ 1 mod p`, which means that
`a**(p-2)` is the modular multiplicative inverse of a in Fp.

NOTE: this function does NOT check that `p` is a prime greater than `2`.

<a id="Math-modExp-uint256-uint256-uint256-"></a>

### `modExp(uint256 b, uint256 e, uint256 m) → uint256`
*internal*

Returns the modular exponentiation of the specified base, exponent and modulus (b ** e % m)

Requirements:
- modulus can't be zero
- underlying staticcall to precompile must succeed

IMPORTANT: The result is only valid if the underlying call succeeds. When using this function, make
sure the chain you're using it on supports the precompiled contract for modular exponentiation
at address 0x05 as specified in [EIP-198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-198). Otherwise,
the underlying function will succeed given the lack of a revert, but the result may be incorrectly
interpreted as 0.

<a id="Math-tryModExp-uint256-uint256-uint256-"></a>

### `tryModExp(uint256 b, uint256 e, uint256 m) → bool success, uint256 result`
*internal*

Returns the modular exponentiation of the specified base, exponent and modulus (b ** e % m).
It includes a success flag indicating if the operation succeeded. Operation will be marked as failed if trying
to operate modulo 0 or if the underlying precompile reverted.

IMPORTANT: The result is only valid if the success flag is true. When using this function, make sure the chain
you're using it on supports the precompiled contract for modular exponentiation at address 0x05 as specified in
[EIP-198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-198). Otherwise, the underlying function will succeed given the lack
of a revert, but the result may be incorrectly interpreted as 0.

### `log256(uint256 x) → uint256 r`
*internal*

Return the log in base 256 of a positive value rounded towards zero.
Returns 0 if given 0.

Adding one to the result gives the number of pairs of hex symbols needed to represent `value` as a hex string.

<a id="SafeCast"></a>

## `SafeCast` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol";
```

Wrappers over Solidity's uintXX/intXX/bool casting operators with added overflow
checks.

Downcasting from uint256/int256 in Solidity does not revert on overflow. This can
easily result in undesired exploitation or bugs, since developers usually
assume that overflows raise errors. `SafeCast` restores this intuition by
reverting the transaction when such an operation overflows.

Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

BitMaps pack 256 booleans across each bit of a single 256-bit slot of `uint256` type.
Hence booleans corresponding to 256 _sequential_ indices would only consume a single slot,
unlike the regular `bool` which would consume an entire slot for a single value.

This results in gas savings in two ways:

- Setting a zero value to non-zero only once every 256 times
- Accessing the same warm slot for every 256 _sequential_ indices

## `Checkpoints` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/structs/Checkpoints.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/Checkpoints.sol";
```

This library defines the `Trace*` struct, for checkpointing values as they change at different points in
time, and later looking up past values by block number. See [`Votes`](governance#Votes) as an example.

To create a history of checkpoints define a variable type `Checkpoints.Trace*` in your contract, and store a new
checkpoint for the current transaction block using the [`Checkpoints.push`](#Checkpoints-push-struct-Checkpoints-Trace160-uint96-uint160-) function.

## `CircularBuffer` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/structs/CircularBuffer.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/CircularBuffer.sol";
```

A fixed-size buffer for keeping `bytes32` items in storage.

This data structure allows for pushing elements to it, and when its length exceeds the specified fixed size,
new items take the place of the oldest element in the buffer, keeping at most `N` elements in the
structure.

Elements can't be removed but the data structure can be cleared. See [`CircularBuffer.clear`](#CircularBuffer-clear-struct-CircularBuffer-Bytes32CircularBuffer-).

Complexity:
- insertion ([`Checkpoints.push`](#Checkpoints-push-struct-Checkpoints-Trace160-uint96-uint160-)): O(1)
- lookup ([`CircularBuffer.last`](#CircularBuffer-last-struct-CircularBuffer-Bytes32CircularBuffer-uint256-)): O(1)
- inclusion ([`CircularBuffer.includes`](#CircularBuffer-includes-struct-CircularBuffer-Bytes32CircularBuffer-bytes32-)): O(N) (worst case)
- reset ([`CircularBuffer.clear`](#CircularBuffer-clear-struct-CircularBuffer-Bytes32CircularBuffer-)): O(1)

* The struct is called `Bytes32CircularBuffer`. Other types can be cast to and from `bytes32`. This data structure
can only be used in storage, and not in memory.

Example usage:

```solidity
contract Example {
    // Add the library methods
    using CircularBuffer for CircularBuffer.Bytes32CircularBuffer;

    // Declare a buffer storage variable
    CircularBuffer.Bytes32CircularBuffer private myBuffer;
}
```

### `setup(struct CircularBuffer.Bytes32CircularBuffer self, uint256 size)`
*internal*

Initialize a new CircularBuffer of a given size.

If the CircularBuffer was already setup and used, calling that function again will reset it to a blank state.

NOTE: The size of the buffer will affect the execution of [`CircularBuffer.includes`](#CircularBuffer-includes-struct-CircularBuffer-Bytes32CircularBuffer-bytes32-) function, as it has a complexity of O(N).
Consider a large buffer size may render the function unusable.

```

A sequence of items with the ability to efficiently push and pop items (i.e. insert and remove) on both ends of
the sequence (called front and back). Among other access patterns, it can be used to implement efficient LIFO and
FIFO queues. Storage use is optimized, and all operations are O(1) constant time. This includes [`CircularBuffer.clear`](#CircularBuffer-clear-struct-CircularBuffer-Bytes32CircularBuffer-), given that
the existing queue contents are left in storage.

The struct is called `Bytes32Deque`. Other types can be cast to and from `bytes32`. This data structure can only be
used in storage, and not in memory.

```

Library for managing an enumerable variant of Solidity's
[`mapping`](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#mapping-types)
type.

Maps have the following properties:

- Entries are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
(O(1)).
- Entries are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
- Map can be cleared (all entries removed) in O(n).

```solidity

[WARNING]
====
Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
unusable.
See [ethereum/solidity#11843](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843) for more info.

In order to clean an EnumerableMap, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
array of EnumerableMap.

## `EnumerableSet` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol";
```

Library for managing
[sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) of primitive
types.

Sets have the following properties:

- Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
(O(1)).
- Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
- Set can be cleared (all elements removed) in O(n).

```solidity
contract Example {
    // Add the library methods
    using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;

    // Declare a set state variable
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;
}
```

The following types are supported:

- `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`) since v3.3.0
- `address` (`AddressSet`) since v3.3.0
- `uint256` (`UintSet`) since v3.3.0
- `string` (`StringSet`) since v5.4.0
- `bytes` (`BytesSet`) since v5.4.0

[WARNING]
====
Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
unusable.
See [ethereum/solidity#11843](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843) for more info.

In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
array of EnumerableSet.

<a id="Heap"></a>

## `Heap` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/structs/Heap.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/Heap.sol";
```

Library for managing [binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) that can be used as
[priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue).

Heaps are represented as a tree of values where the first element (index 0) is the root, and where the node at
index i is the child of the node at index (i-1)/2 and the parent of nodes at index 2*i+1 and 2*i+2. Each node
stores an element of the heap.

The structure is ordered so that each node is bigger than its parent. An immediate consequence is that the
highest priority value is the one at the root. This value can be looked up in constant time (O(1)) at
`heap.tree[0]`

The structure is designed to perform the following operations with the corresponding complexities:

* peek (get the highest priority value): O(1)
* insert (insert a value): O(log(n))
* pop (remove the highest priority value): O(log(n))
* replace (replace the highest priority value with a new value): O(log(n))
* length (get the number of elements): O(1)
* clear (remove all elements): O(1)

IMPORTANT: This library allows for the use of custom comparator functions. Given that manipulating
memory can lead to unexpected behavior. Consider verifying that the comparator does not manipulate
the Heap's state directly and that it follows the Solidity memory safety rules.

_Available since v5.1._

## `MerkleTree` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/structs/MerkleTree.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/MerkleTree.sol";
```

Library for managing [Merkle Tree](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_Tree) data structures.

Each tree is a complete binary tree with the ability to sequentially insert leaves, changing them from a zero to a
non-zero value and updating its root. This structure allows inserting commitments (or other entries) that are not
stored, but can be proven to be part of the tree at a later time if the root is kept. See [`MerkleProof`](cryptography#MerkleProof).

A tree is defined by the following parameters:

* Depth: The number of levels in the tree, it also defines the maximum number of leaves as 2**depth.
* Zero value: The value that represents an empty leaf. Used to avoid regular zero values to be part of the tree.
* Hashing function: A cryptographic hash function used to produce internal nodes. Defaults to [`Hashes.commutativeKeccak256`](cryptography#Hashes-commutativeKeccak256-bytes32-bytes32-).

NOTE: Building trees using non-commutative hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) != H(b, a)`) is supported. However,
proving the inclusion of a leaf in such trees is not possible with the [`MerkleProof`](cryptography#MerkleProof) library since it only supports
_commutative_ hashing functions.

_Available since v5.1._

### `setup(struct MerkleTree.Bytes32PushTree self, uint8 treeDepth, bytes32 zero) → bytes32 initialRoot`
*internal*

Initialize a [`MerkleTree.Bytes32PushTree`](#MerkleTree-Bytes32PushTree) using [`Hashes.commutativeKeccak256`](cryptography#Hashes-commutativeKeccak256-bytes32-bytes32-) to hash internal nodes.
The capacity of the tree (i.e. number of leaves) is set to `2**treeDepth`.

Calling this function on MerkleTree that was already setup and used will reset it to a blank state.

Once a tree is setup, any push to it must use the same hashing function. This means that values
should be pushed to it using the default [push](#MerkleTree-push-struct-MerkleTree-Bytes32PushTree-bytes32-) function.

IMPORTANT: The zero value should be carefully chosen since it will be stored in the tree representing
empty leaves. It should be a value that is not expected to be part of the tree.

<a id="MerkleTree-setup-struct-MerkleTree-Bytes32PushTree-uint8-bytes32-function--bytes32-bytes32--view-returns--bytes32--"></a>

### `setup(struct MerkleTree.Bytes32PushTree self, uint8 treeDepth, bytes32 zero, function (bytes32,bytes32) view returns (bytes32) fnHash) → bytes32 initialRoot`
*internal*

Same as [setup](#MerkleTree-setup-struct-MerkleTree-Bytes32PushTree-uint8-bytes32-), but allows to specify a custom hashing function.

Once a tree is setup, any push to it must use the same hashing function. This means that values
should be pushed to it using the custom push function, which should be the same one as used during the setup.

IMPORTANT: Providing a custom hashing function is a security-sensitive operation since it may
compromise the soundness of the tree.

NOTE: Consider verifying that the hashing function does not manipulate the memory state directly and that it
follows the Solidity memory safety rules. Otherwise, it may lead to unexpected behavior.

<a id="MerkleTree-push-struct-MerkleTree-Bytes32PushTree-bytes32-"></a>

### `push(struct MerkleTree.Bytes32PushTree self, bytes32 leaf) → uint256 index, bytes32 newRoot`
*internal*

Insert a new leaf in the tree, and compute the new root. Returns the position of the inserted leaf in the
tree, and the resulting root.

Hashing the leaf before calling this function is recommended as a protection against
second pre-image attacks.

This variant uses [`Hashes.commutativeKeccak256`](cryptography#Hashes-commutativeKeccak256-bytes32-bytes32-) to hash internal nodes. It should only be used on merkle trees
that were setup using the same (default) hashing function (i.e. by calling
[the default setup](#MerkleTree-setup-struct-MerkleTree-Bytes32PushTree-uint8-bytes32-) function).

### `push(struct MerkleTree.Bytes32PushTree self, bytes32 leaf, function (bytes32,bytes32) view returns (bytes32) fnHash) → uint256 index, bytes32 newRoot`
*internal*

Insert a new leaf in the tree, and compute the new root. Returns the position of the inserted leaf in the
tree, and the resulting root.

Hashing the leaf before calling this function is recommended as a protection against

This variant uses a custom hashing function to hash internal nodes. It should only be called with the same
function as the one used during the initial setup of the merkle tree.

### `update(struct MerkleTree.Bytes32PushTree self, uint256 index, bytes32 oldValue, bytes32 newValue, bytes32[] proof) → bytes32 oldRoot, bytes32 newRoot`
*internal*

Change the value of the leaf at position `index` from `oldValue` to `newValue`. Returns the recomputed "old"
root (before the update) and "new" root (after the update). The caller must verify that the reconstructed old
root is the last known one.

The `proof` must be an up-to-date inclusion proof for the leaf being updated. This means that this function is
vulnerable to front-running. Any [`Checkpoints.push`](#Checkpoints-push-struct-Checkpoints-Trace160-uint96-uint160-) or [`MerkleTree.update`](#MerkleTree-update-struct-MerkleTree-Bytes32PushTree-uint256-bytes32-bytes32-bytes32---function--bytes32-bytes32--view-returns--bytes32--) operation (that changes the root of the tree) would render
all "in flight" updates invalid.

## `Time` [📁](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.4.0/contracts/utils/types/Time.sol)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/types/Time.sol";
```

This library provides helpers for manipulating time-related objects.

It uses the following types:
- `uint48` for timepoints
- `uint32` for durations

While the library doesn't provide specific types for timepoints and duration, it does provide:
- a `Delay` type to represent duration that can be programmed to change value automatically at a given point
- additional helper functions

<a id="Time-timestamp--"></a>

### `timestamp() → uint48`
*internal*

Get the block timestamp as a Timepoint.

<a id="Time-blockNumber--"></a>

### `blockNumber() → uint48`
*internal*

Get the block number as a Timepoint.

<a id="Time-toDelay-uint32-"></a>

### `toDelay(uint32 duration) → Time.Delay`
*internal*

Wrap a duration into a Delay to add the one-step "update in the future" feature

<a id="Time-getFull-Time-Delay-"></a>

### `getFull(Time.Delay self) → uint32 valueBefore, uint32 valueAfter, uint48 effect`
*internal*

Get the current value plus the pending value and effect timepoint if there is a scheduled change. If the
effect timepoint is 0, then the pending value should not be considered.

<a id="Time-get-Time-Delay-"></a>

### `get(Time.Delay self) → uint32`
*internal*

Get the current value.

<a id="Time-withUpdate-Time-Delay-uint32-uint32-"></a>

### `withUpdate(Time.Delay self, uint32 newValue, uint32 minSetback) → Time.Delay updatedDelay, uint48 effect`
*internal*

Update a Delay object so that it takes a new duration after a timepoint that is automatically computed to
enforce the old delay at the moment of the update. Returns the updated Delay object and the timestamp when the
new delay becomes effective.

<a id="Time-unpack-Time-Delay-"></a>

### `unpack(Time.Delay self) → uint32 valueBefore, uint32 valueAfter, uint48 effect`
*internal*

Split a delay into its components: valueBefore, valueAfter and effect (transition timepoint).

<a id="Time-pack-uint32-uint32-uint48-"></a>

### `pack(uint32 valueBefore, uint32 valueAfter, uint48 effect) → Time.Delay`
*internal*

pack the components into a Delay object.
