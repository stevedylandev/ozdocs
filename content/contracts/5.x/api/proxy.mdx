This is a low-level set of contracts implementing different proxy patterns with and without upgradeability. For an in-depth overview of this pattern check out the [Proxy Upgrade Pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/proxies) page.

Most of the proxies below are built on an abstract base contract.

* [`Proxy`](#Proxy): Abstract contract implementing the core delegation functionality.

In order to avoid clashes with the storage variables of the implementation contract behind a proxy, we use [ERC-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) storage slots.

* [`ERC1967Utils`](#ERC1967Utils): Internal functions to get and set the storage slots defined in ERC-1967.
* [`ERC1967Proxy`](#ERC1967Proxy): A proxy using ERC-1967 storage slots. Not upgradeable by default.

There are two alternative ways to add upgradeability to an ERC-1967 proxy. Their differences are explained below in [Transparent vs UUPS Proxies](#transparent-vs-uups-proxies).

* [`TransparentUpgradeableProxy`](#TransparentUpgradeableProxy): A proxy with a built-in immutable admin and upgrade interface.
* [`UUPSUpgradeable`](#UUPSUpgradeable): An upgradeability mechanism to be included in the implementation contract.

**🔥 CAUTION**\
Using upgradeable proxies correctly and securely is a difficult task that requires deep knowledge of the proxy pattern, Solidity, and the EVM. Unless you want a lot of low level control, we recommend using the [OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins) for Hardhat and Foundry.

A different family of proxies are beacon proxies. This pattern, popularized by Dharma, allows multiple proxies to be upgraded to a different implementation in a single transaction.

* [`BeaconProxy`](#BeaconProxy): A proxy that retrieves its implementation from a beacon contract.
* [`UpgradeableBeacon`](#UpgradeableBeacon): A beacon contract with a built in admin that can upgrade the [`BeaconProxy`](#BeaconProxy) pointing to it.

In this pattern, the proxy contract doesn’t hold the implementation address in storage like an ERC-1967 proxy. Instead, the address is stored in a separate beacon contract. The `upgrade` operations are sent to the beacon instead of to the proxy contract, and all proxies that follow that beacon are automatically upgraded.

Outside the realm of upgradeability, proxies can also be useful to make cheap contract clones, such as those created by an on-chain factory contract that creates many instances of the same contract. These instances are designed to be both cheap to deploy, and cheap to call.

* [`Clones`](#Clones): A library that can deploy cheap minimal non-upgradeable proxies.

## Transparent vs UUPS Proxies

The original proxies included in OpenZeppelin followed the [Transparent Proxy Pattern](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/). While this pattern is still provided, our recommendation is now shifting towards UUPS proxies, which are both lightweight and versatile. The name UUPS comes from [ERC-1822](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822), which first documented the pattern.

While both of these share the same interface for upgrades, in UUPS proxies the upgrade is handled by the implementation, and can eventually be removed. Transparent proxies, on the other hand, include the upgrade and admin logic in the proxy itself. This means [`TransparentUpgradeableProxy`](#TransparentUpgradeableProxy) is more expensive to deploy than what is possible with UUPS proxies.

UUPS proxies are implemented using an [`ERC1967Proxy`](#ERC1967Proxy). Note that this proxy is not by itself upgradeable. It is the role of the implementation to include, alongside the contract’s logic, all the code necessary to update the implementation’s address that is stored at a specific slot in the proxy’s storage space. This is where the [`UUPSUpgradeable`](#UUPSUpgradeable) contract comes in. Inheriting from it (and overriding the [`_authorizeUpgrade`](#UUPSUpgradeable-_authorizeUpgrade-address-) function with the relevant access control mechanism) will turn your contract into a UUPS compliant implementation.

Note that since both proxies use the same storage slot for the implementation address, using a UUPS compliant implementation with a [`TransparentUpgradeableProxy`](#TransparentUpgradeableProxy) might allow non-admins to perform upgrade operations.

By default, the upgrade functionality included in [`UUPSUpgradeable`](#UUPSUpgradeable) contains a security mechanism that will prevent any upgrades to a non UUPS compliant implementation. This prevents upgrades to an implementation contract that wouldn’t contain the necessary upgrade mechanism, as it would lock the upgradeability of the proxy forever. This security mechanism can be bypassed by either of:

* Adding a flag mechanism in the implementation that will disable the upgrade function when triggered.
* Upgrading to an implementation that features an upgrade mechanism without the additional security check, and then upgrading again to another implementation without the upgrade mechanism.

The current implementation of this security mechanism uses [ERC-1822](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822) to detect the storage slot used by the implementation. A previous implementation, now deprecated, relied on a rollback check. It is possible to upgrade from a contract using the old mechanism to a new one. The inverse is however not possible, as old implementations (before version 4.5) did not include the ERC-1822 interface.

[ERC-1167](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) is a standard for
deploying minimal proxy contracts, also known as "clones".

> To simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way, this standard specifies
> a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a known, fixed address.

The library includes functions to deploy a proxy using either `create` (traditional deployment) or `create2`
(salted deterministic deployment). It also includes functions to predict the addresses of clones deployed using the
deterministic method.

This contract implements an upgradeable proxy. It is upgradeable because calls are delegated to an
implementation address that can be changed. This address is stored in storage in the location specified by
[ERC-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967), so that it doesn't conflict with the storage layout of the
implementation behind the proxy.

This abstract contract provides a fallback function that delegates all calls to another contract using the EVM
instruction `delegatecall`. We refer to the second contract as the _implementation_ behind the proxy, and it has to
be specified by overriding the virtual [`ERC1967Proxy._implementation`](#ERC1967Proxy-_implementation--) function.

Additionally, delegation to the implementation can be triggered manually through the [`AccountERC7579._fallback`](account#AccountERC7579-_fallback--) function, or to a
different contract through the [`Votes._delegate`](governance#Votes-_delegate-address-address-) function.

The success and return data of the delegated call will be returned back to the caller of the proxy.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/beacon/BeaconProxy.sol";
```

This contract implements a proxy that gets the implementation address for each call from an [`UpgradeableBeacon`](#UpgradeableBeacon).

The beacon address can only be set once during construction, and cannot be changed afterwards. It is stored in an
immutable variable to avoid unnecessary storage reads, and also in the beacon storage slot specified by
[ERC-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) so that it can be accessed externally.

CAUTION: Since the beacon address can never be changed, you must ensure that you either control the beacon, or trust
the beacon to not upgrade the implementation maliciously.

<Callout type="warn">
Do not use the implementation logic to modify the beacon storage slot. Doing so would leave the proxy in
</Callout>
an inconsistent state where the beacon storage slot does not match the beacon address.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol";
```

This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable through an associated [`ProxyAdmin`](#ProxyAdmin) instance.

To avoid [proxy selector
clashing](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357), which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
[transparent proxy pattern](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/). This pattern implies two
things that go hand in hand:

1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
that call matches the [`ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.upgradeToAndCall`](#ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall-address-bytes-) function exposed by the proxy itself.
2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to
the implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating
the proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.

These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a
dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to
call a function from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of [`ProxyAdmin`](#ProxyAdmin) and
allows upgrades only if they come through it. You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative
interface of the proxy, including the ability to change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.

<Callout>
The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
</Callout>
inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch
mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to
fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
implementation.

<Callout>
This proxy does not inherit from [`Context`](utils#Context) deliberately. The [`ProxyAdmin`](#ProxyAdmin) of this contract won't send a
</Callout>
meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.

<Callout type="warn">
This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an
</Callout>
immutable variable, preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be
overwritten by the implementation logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an
undesirable state where the admin slot is different from the actual admin. Relying on the value of the admin slot
is generally fine if the implementation is trusted.

<Callout type="warn">
It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the
</Callout>
compiler will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new
function and the functions declared in [`ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`](#ITransparentUpgradeableProxy) will be resolved in favor of the new one. This
could render the `upgradeToAndCall` function inaccessible, preventing upgradeability and compromising transparency.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
```

This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
function so it can only be called once. The [`Initializable.initializer`](#Initializable-initializer--) modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.

The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.

For example:

[.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
```solidity
contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
    function initialize() initializer public {
        __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
    }
}

contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
    function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
        __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
    }
}
```

<Callout>
To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
</Callout>
possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to [`ERC1967Proxy.constructor`](#ERC1967Proxy-constructor-address-bytes-).

CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.

<Callout type="warn">
Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.

An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
the [`Initializable._disableInitializers`](#Initializable-_disableInitializers--) function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

[.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
```
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

An upgradeability mechanism designed for UUPS proxies. The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an
[`ERC1967Proxy`](#ERC1967Proxy), when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy.

A security mechanism ensures that an upgrade does not turn off upgradeability accidentally, although this risk is
reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing
`UUPSUpgradeable` with a custom implementation of upgrades.

The [`UUPSUpgradeable._authorizeUpgrade`](#UUPSUpgradeable-_authorizeUpgrade-address-) function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism.
