title: Setting up a Node project
---

New software industries often start out with every project sharing the same technology stack. The Ethereum ecosystem is no exception, and the language of choice is [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Many Ethereum libraries, including OpenZeppelin software, are written in JavaScript or one of its variants.

JavaScript code is traditionally run on a web browser as part of a website, but it can be also executed as a standalone process using [Node](https://nodejs.org).

This guide will help you get your Node development environment set up, which you’ll need to use the different OpenZeppelin tools and other third party products.

## Installing Node

There are multiple ways to get Node on your machine: you can get it either via a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or by downloading [the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) directly.

<Callout>
If you are running Windows consider using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2) as much of the ecosystem is written for Linux.
</Callout>

Once you’re done, run `node --version` on a terminal to check your installation: any [active or maintenance version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) should be compatible with most Ethereum software.

```console
$ node --version
v20.17.0
```

## Creating a project

JavaScript software is often bundled in _packages_, which are distributed via the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). A package is simply a directory that contains a file called `package.json`, describing the package’s name, version, content, and others. When you build your own project, you will be creating a package, even if you don’t plan to distribute it.

All Node installations include a command-line client for the npm registry, which you’ll use while developing your own projects. To start a new project, create a directory for it:

```console
$ mkdir learn && cd learn
```

Then we can initialize it:

```console
$ npm init -y
```

Simple as that! Your newly created `package.json` file will evolve as your project grows, such as when installing dependencies with `npm install`.

JavaScript and npm are some of the most used software tools in the world: if you’re ever in doubt, you’ll find plenty of information about them online.

### Using `npx`

There are two broads type of packages stored in the npm registry: _libraries_ and _executables_. Installed libraries are used like any other piece of JavaScript code, but executables are special.

A third binary was included when installing node: [`npx`](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner). This is used to run executables installed locally in your project.

Whilst [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) can be installed globally we recommend installing locally in each project so that you can control the version on a project by project basis.

For clarity we’ll display the full command in our guides including `npx` so we don’t get errors due to the binary not being in the system path:

```console
$ hardhat init
hardhat: command not found
$ npx hardhat init
👷 Welcome to Hardhat v2.22.12 👷‍
? What do you want to do? … 
```

<Callout type='warn'>
Make sure you are inside your project’s directory when running `npx`! Otherwise, it will download the full executable again just to run that command, which most of the time is _not_ what you want.
</Callout>

## Tracking with Version Control

Before you get coding, you should add [version control software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) to your project to track changes.

By far, the most used tool is [Git](https://git-scm.com), often in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting purposes. Indeed, you will find the full source code and history of all OpenZeppelin software in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin).

<Callout>
If you’ve never used Git before, a good starting place is the [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).
</Callout>

<Callout type='warn'>
Don’t commit secrets such as mnemonics, private keys and API keys to version control! Make sure you [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) files with secrets.
