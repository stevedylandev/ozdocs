## Libraries

### ``SafeMath``

Wrappers over Solidity’s arithmetic operations with added overflow
checks.

Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
`SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
operation overflows.

Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
class of bugs, so it’s recommended to use it always.

Returns the addition of two unsigned integers, reverting on
overflow.

Counterpart to Solidity’s `+` operator.

Requirements:

* Addition cannot overflow.

#### `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256 *internal*`

Returns the subtraction of two unsigned integers, reverting on
overflow (when the result is negative).

Returns the integer division of two unsigned integers, reverting on
division by zero. The result is rounded towards zero.

Counterpart to Solidity’s `/` operator. Note: this function uses a
`revert` opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity
uses an invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

* The divisor cannot be zero.

<a id="SafeMath-mod"></a>

#### `mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256 *internal*`

Returns the remainder of dividing two unsigned integers. (unsigned integer modulo),
reverting when dividing by zero.

Counterpart to Solidity’s `%` operator. This function uses a `revert`
opcode (which leaves remaining gas untouched) while Solidity uses an
invalid opcode to revert (consuming all remaining gas).

Requirements:

* The divisor cannot be zero.

<a id="SafeMath-sub"></a>

#### `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b, string errorMessage) → uint256 *internal*`

Returns the subtraction of two unsigned integers, reverting with custom message on
overflow (when the result is negative).

<Callout type='warn'>
This function is deprecated because it requires allocating memory for the error
message unnecessarily. For custom revert reasons use trySub.
