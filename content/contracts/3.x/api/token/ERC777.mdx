This set of interfaces and contracts are all related to the [ERC777 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777).

<Callout>
For an overview of ERC777 tokens and a walk through on how to create a token contract read our [ERC777 guide](/contracts/3.x/erc777).
</Callout>

The token behavior itself is implemented in the core contracts: IERC777, ERC777.

Additionally there are interfaces used to develop contracts that react to token movements: IERC777Sender, IERC777Recipient.

## Core

### ``IERC777``

Interface of the ERC777Token standard as defined in the EIP.

This contract uses the
[ERC1820 registry standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) to let
token holders and recipients react to token movements by using setting implementers
for the associated interfaces in said registry. See IERC1820Registry and
ERC1820Implementer.

<a id="IERC777-name"></a>

#### `name() → string *external*`

Returns the name of the token.

<a id="IERC777-symbol"></a>

#### `symbol() → string *external*`

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name.

<a id="IERC777-granularity"></a>

#### `granularity() → uint256 *external*`

Returns the smallest part of the token that is not divisible. This
means all token operations (creation, movement and destruction) must have
amounts that are a multiple of this number.

For most token contracts, this value will equal 1.

<a id="IERC777-totalSupply"></a>

#### `totalSupply() → uint256 *external*`

Returns the amount of tokens in existence.

<a id="IERC777-balanceOf"></a>

#### `balanceOf(address owner) → uint256 *external*`

Returns the amount of tokens owned by an account (`owner`).

<a id="IERC777-send"></a>

#### `send(address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes data) *external*`

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller’s account to `recipient`.

If send or receive hooks are registered for the caller and `recipient`,
the corresponding functions will be called with `data` and empty
`operatorData`. See IERC777Sender and IERC777Recipient.

Emits a Sent event.

Requirements

* the caller must have at least `amount` tokens.
* `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
* if `recipient` is a contract, it must implement the IERC777Recipient
interface.

<a id="IERC777-burn"></a>

#### `burn(uint256 amount, bytes data) *external*`

Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller’s account, reducing the
total supply.

If a send hook is registered for the caller, the corresponding function
will be called with `data` and empty `operatorData`. See IERC777Sender.

Emits a Burned event.

Requirements

* the caller must have at least `amount` tokens.

<a id="IERC777-isOperatorFor"></a>

#### `isOperatorFor(address operator, address tokenHolder) → bool *external*`

Returns true if an account is an operator of `tokenHolder`.
Operators can send and burn tokens on behalf of their owners. All
accounts are their own operator.

See operatorSend and operatorBurn.

<a id="IERC777-authorizeOperator"></a>

#### `authorizeOperator(address operator) *external*

Make an account an operator of the caller.

See isOperatorFor.

Emits an AuthorizedOperator event.

Requirements

*` `operator` cannot be calling address.

<a id="IERC777-revokeOperator"></a>

#### `revokeOperator(address operator) *external*

Revoke an account’s operator status for the caller.

See isOperatorFor and defaultOperators.

Emits a RevokedOperator event.

Requirements

*` `operator` cannot be calling address.

<a id="IERC777-defaultOperators"></a>

#### `defaultOperators() → address[] *external*`

Returns the list of default operators. These accounts are operators
for all token holders, even if authorizeOperator was never called on
them.

This list is immutable, but individual holders may revoke these via
revokeOperator, in which case isOperatorFor will return false.

<a id="IERC777-operatorSend"></a>

#### `operatorSend(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData) *external*`

Moves `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient`. The caller must
be an operator of `sender`.

If send or receive hooks are registered for `sender` and `recipient`,
the corresponding functions will be called with `data` and
`operatorData`. See IERC777Sender and IERC777Recipient.

Emits a Sent event.

Requirements

* `sender` cannot be the zero address.
* `sender` must have at least `amount` tokens.
* the caller must be an operator for `sender`.
* `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
* if `recipient` is a contract, it must implement the IERC777Recipient
interface.

<a id="IERC777-operatorBurn"></a>

#### `operatorBurn(address account, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData) *external*`

Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, reducing the total supply.
The caller must be an operator of `account`.

If a send hook is registered for `account`, the corresponding function
will be called with `data` and `operatorData`. See IERC777Sender.

Emits a Burned event.

Requirements

<a id="IERC777-Burned"></a>

#### `Burned(address operator, address from, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData) *event*`

<a id="IERC777-AuthorizedOperator"></a>

#### `AuthorizedOperator(address operator, address tokenHolder) *event*`

<a id="IERC777-RevokedOperator"></a>

#### `RevokedOperator(address operator, address tokenHolder) *event*`

### ``ERC777``

Implementation of the IERC777 interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using _mint.

Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both
the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.
Both IERC777-Sent and IERC20-Transfer events are emitted on token
movements.

Additionally, the IERC777-granularity value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there
are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or
destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.

will be to transferred to `to`.
* when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
* when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from`’s tokens will be burned.
* `from` and `to` are never both zero.

## Hooks

### ``IERC777Sender``

Interface of the ERC777TokensSender standard as defined in the EIP.

IERC777 Token holders can be notified of operations performed on their
tokens by having a contract implement this interface (contract holders can be
 their own implementer) and registering it on the
[ERC1820 global registry](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820).

See IERC1820Registry and ERC1820Implementer.

**Functions**

* [`tokensToSend(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData)`](#IERC777Sender-tokensToSend-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-)

<a id="IERC777-tokensToSend"></a>

#### `tokensToSend(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) *external*`

Called by an IERC777 token contract whenever a registered holder’s
(`from`) tokens are about to be moved or destroyed. The type of operation
is conveyed by `to` being the zero address or not.

This call occurs _before_ the token contract’s state is updated, so
IERC777-balanceOf, etc., can be used to query the pre-operation state.

This function may revert to prevent the operation from being executed.

### ``IERC777Recipient``

Interface of the ERC777TokensRecipient standard as defined in the EIP.

Accounts can be notified of IERC777 tokens being sent to them by having a
contract implement this interface (contract holders can be their own
implementer) and registering it on the
[ERC1820 global registry](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820).

See IERC1820Registry and ERC1820Implementer.

**Functions**

* [`tokensReceived(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData)`](#IERC777Recipient-tokensReceived-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-)

<a id="IERC777-tokensReceived"></a>

#### `tokensReceived(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) *external*`

Called by an IERC777 token contract whenever tokens are being
moved or created into a registered account (`to`). The type of operation
is conveyed by `from` being the zero address or not.

This call occurs _after_ the token contract’s state is updated, so
IERC777-balanceOf, etc., can be used to query the post-operation state.

This function may revert to prevent the operation from being executed.
