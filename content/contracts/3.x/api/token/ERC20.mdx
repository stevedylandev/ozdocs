This set of interfaces, contracts, and utilities are all related to the [ERC20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).

<Callout>
For an overview of ERC20 tokens and a walk through on how to create a token contract read our [ERC20 guide](/contracts/3.x/erc20).
</Callout>

There a few core contracts that implement the behavior specified in the EIP:

* IERC20: the interface all ERC20 implementations should conform to.
* ERC20: the implementation of the ERC20 interface, including the [`name`](#ERC20-name), [`symbol`](#ERC20-symbol) and [`decimals`](#ERC20-decimals) optional standard extension to the base interface.

Additionally there are multiple custom extensions, including:

* ERC20Permit: gasless approval of tokens.
* ERC20Snapshot: efficient storage of past token balances to be later queried at any point in time.
* ERC20Burnable: destruction of own tokens.
* ERC20Capped: enforcement of a cap to the total supply when minting tokens.
* ERC20Pausable: ability to pause token transfers.

Finally, there are some utilities to interact with ERC20 contracts in various ways.

* SafeERC20: a wrapper around the interface that eliminates the need to handle boolean return values.
* TokenTimelock: hold tokens for a beneficiary until a specified time.

The following related EIPs are in draft status and can be found in the drafts directory.

* IERC20Permit
* ERC20Permit

<Callout>
This core set of contracts is designed to be unopinionated, allowing developers to access the internal functions in ERC20 (such as [`_mint`](#`_mint(address-account,-uint256-amount) *internal*`)) and expose them as external functions in the way they prefer. On the other hand, [ERC20 Presets](/contracts/3.x/erc20#preset-erc20-contract) (such as ERC20PresetMinterPauser) are designed using opinionated patterns to provide developers with ready to use, deployable contracts.
</Callout>

## Core

### ``IERC20``

Interface of the ERC20 standard as defined in the EIP.

**Functions**

* [`totalSupply()`](#IERC20-totalSupply)
* [`balanceOf(account)`](#IERC20-balanceOf-address-)
* [`transfer(recipient, amount)`](#IERC20-transfer-address-uint256-)
* [`allowance(owner, spender)`](#IERC20-allowance-address-address-)
* [`approve(spender, amount)`](#IERC20-approve-address-uint256-)
* [`transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount)`](#IERC20-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-)

**Events**

* [`Transfer(from, to, value)`](#IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-)
* [`Approval(owner, spender, value)`](#IERC20-Approval-address-address-uint256-)

<a id="IERC20-totalSupply"></a>

#### `totalSupply() → uint256 *external*`

Returns the amount of tokens in existence.

<a id="IERC20-balanceOf"></a>

#### `balanceOf(address account) → uint256 *external*`

Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.

<a id="IERC20-transfer"></a>

#### `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool *external*`

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller’s account to `recipient`.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

Emits a Transfer event.

<a id="IERC20-allowance"></a>

#### `allowance(address owner, address spender) → uint256 *external*`

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through transferFrom. This is
zero by default.

This value changes when approve or transferFrom are called.

<a id="IERC20-approve"></a>

#### `approve(address spender, uint256 amount) → bool *external*`

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller’s tokens.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

<Callout type='warn'>
Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender’s allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
</Callout>

Emits an Approval event.

<a id="IERC20-transferFrom"></a>

#### `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool *external*`

Moves `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient` using the
allowance mechanism. `amount` is then deducted from the caller’s
allowance.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

Emits a Transfer event.

<a id="IERC20-Transfer"></a>

#### `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value) *event*`

Emitted when `value` tokens are moved from one account (`from`) to
another (`to`).

Note that `value` may be zero.

<a id="IERC20-Approval"></a>

#### `Approval(address owner, address spender, uint256 value) *event*`

Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by
a call to approve. `value` is the new allowance.

### ``ERC20``

Implementation of the IERC20 interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using _mint.
For a generic mechanism see ERC20PresetMinterPauser.

<Callout>
For a detailed writeup see our guide
https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
to implement supply mechanisms].
</Callout>

We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.

Additionally, an Approval event is emitted on calls to transferFrom.
This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
these events, as it isn’t required by the specification.

Finally, the non-standard decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance
functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
allowances. See IERC20-approve.

**IERC20**

* [`Transfer(from, to, value)`](#IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-)
* [`Approval(owner, spender, value)`](#IERC20-Approval-address-address-uint256-)

<a id="IERC20-constructor"></a>

#### `constructor(string name_, string symbol_) *public*`

Sets the values for name and symbol, initializes decimals with
a default value of 18.

To select a different value for decimals, use _setupDecimals.

All three of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
construction.

<a id="IERC20-name"></a>

#### `name() → string *public*`

Returns the name of the token.

<a id="IERC20-symbol"></a>

#### `symbol() → string *public*`

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name.

<a id="IERC20-decimals"></a>

#### `decimals() → uint8 *public*`

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the value ERC20 uses, unless _setupDecimals is
called.

<Callout>
This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
IERC20-balanceOf and IERC20-transfer.

Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to approve that can be used as a mitigation for
problems described in IERC20-approve.

Emits an Approval event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

* `spender` cannot be the zero address.

<a id="IERC20-decreaseAllowance"></a>

#### `decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) → bool *public*`

* `sender` must have a balance of at least `amount`.

<a id="IERC20-_mint"></a>

#### `_mint(address account, uint256 amount) *internal*`

<a id="IERC20-_setupDecimals"></a>

#### `_setupDecimals(uint8 decimals_) *internal*`

Sets decimals to a value other than the default one of 18.

<Callout type='warn'>
This function should only be called from the constructor. Most
applications that interact with token contracts will not expect
decimals to ever change, and may work incorrectly if it does.
</Callout>

<a id="IERC20-_beforeTokenTransfer"></a>

#### `_beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) *internal*

Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

*` when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from`’s tokens
will be to transferred to `to`.
* when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
* when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from`’s tokens will be burned.
* `from` and `to` are never both zero.

## Extensions

### ``ERC20Snapshot``

This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
total supply at the time are recorded for later access.

This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
In naive implementations it’s possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.

Snapshots are created by the internal _snapshot function, which will emit the Snapshot event and return a
snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function totalSupplyAt with the snapshot
id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the balanceOfAt function with the snapshot id
and the account address.

#### Gas Costs

Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.

There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

<a id="IERC20-_snapshot"></a>

#### `_snapshot() → uint256 *internal*`

Creates a new snapshot and returns its snapshot id.

Emits a Snapshot event that contains the same id.

_snapshot is `internal` and you have to decide how to expose it externally. Its usage may be restricted to a
set of accounts, for example using AccessControl, or it may be open to the public.



While an open way of calling _snapshot is required for certain trust minimization mechanisms such as forking,
you must consider that it can potentially be used by attackers in two ways.

First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target
specific accounts and increase the cost of ERC20 transfers for them, in the ways specified in the Gas Costs
section above.

## Utilities

### ``SafeERC20``

Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token
contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or
throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be
successful.
To use this library you can add a `using SafeERC20 for IERC20;` statement to your contract,
which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(...)`, etc.

**Functions**

* [`safeTransfer(token, to, value)`](#SafeERC20-safeTransfer-contract-IERC20-address-uint256-)
* [`safeTransferFrom(token, from, to, value)`](#SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom-contract-IERC20-address-address-uint256-)
* [`safeApprove(token, spender, value)`](#SafeERC20-safeApprove-contract-IERC20-address-uint256-)
* [`safeIncreaseAllowance(token, spender, value)`](#SafeERC20-safeIncreaseAllowance-contract-IERC20-address-uint256-)
* [`safeDecreaseAllowance(token, spender, value)`](#SafeERC20-safeDecreaseAllowance-contract-IERC20-address-uint256-)

<a id="IERC20-safeTransfer"></a>

#### `safeTransfer(contract IERC20 token, address to, uint256 value) *internal*`

<a id="IERC20-safeTransferFrom"></a>

#### `safeTransferFrom(contract IERC20 token, address from, address to, uint256 value) *internal*`

<a id="IERC20-safeApprove"></a>

#### `safeApprove(contract IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) *internal*`

Deprecated. This function has issues similar to the ones found in
IERC20-approve, and its usage is discouraged.

Whenever possible, use safeIncreaseAllowance and
safeDecreaseAllowance instead.

<a id="IERC20-safeIncreaseAllowance"></a>

#### `safeIncreaseAllowance(contract IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) *internal*`

<a id="IERC20-safeDecreaseAllowance"></a>

#### `safeDecreaseAllowance(contract IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) *internal*`

### ``TokenTimelock``

A token holder contract that will allow a beneficiary to extract the
tokens after a given release time.

Useful for simple vesting schedules like "advisors get all of their tokens
after 1 year".

**Functions**

* [`constructor(token_, beneficiary_, releaseTime_)`](#TokenTimelock-constructor-contract-IERC20-address-uint256-)
* [`token()`](#TokenTimelock-token)
* [`beneficiary()`](#TokenTimelock-beneficiary)
* [`releaseTime()`](#TokenTimelock-releaseTime)
