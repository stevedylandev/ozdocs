This set of interfaces and contracts deal with [type introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection) of contracts, that is, examining which functions can be called on them. This is usually referred to as a contract’s _interface_.

Ethereum contracts have no native concept of an interface, so applications must usually simply trust they are not making an incorrect call. For trusted setups this is a non-issue, but often unknown and untrusted third-party addresses need to be interacted with. There may even not be any direct calls to them! (e.g. `ERC20` tokens may be sent to a contract that lacks a way to transfer them out of it, locking them forever). In these cases, a contract _declaring_ its interface can be very helpful in preventing errors.

There are two main ways to approach this.

* Locally, where a contract implements `IERC165` and declares an interface, and a second one queries it directly via `ERC165Checker`.
* Globally, where a global and unique registry (`IERC1820Registry`) is used to register implementers of a certain interface (`IERC1820Implementer`). It is then the registry that is queried, which allows for more complex setups, like contracts implementing interfaces for externally-owned accounts.

Note that, in all cases, accounts simply _declare_ their interfaces, but they are not required to actually implement them. This mechanism can therefore be used to both prevent errors and allow for complex interactions (see `ERC777`), but it must not be relied on for security.

## Local

### ``IERC165``

Interface of the ERC165 standard, as defined in the
[EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165).

Implementers can declare support of contract interfaces, which can then be
queried by others (ERC165Checker).

For an implementation, see ERC165.

**Functions**

* [`supportsInterface(interfaceId)`](#IERC165-supportsInterface-bytes4-)

<a id="IERC165-supportsInterface"></a>

#### `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) → bool *external*`

Returns true if this contract implements the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. See the corresponding
[EIP section](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165#how-interfaces-are-identified)
to learn more about how these ids are created.

This function call must use less than 30 000 gas.

### ``ERC165``

Implementation of the IERC165 interface.

Contracts may inherit from this and call _registerInterface to declare
their support of an interface.

**Functions**

* [`constructor()`](#ERC165-constructor)
* [`supportsInterface(interfaceId)`](#ERC165-supportsInterface-bytes4-)
* [`_registerInterface(interfaceId)`](#ERC165-_registerInterface-bytes4-)

<a id="IERC165-constructor"></a>

#### `constructor() *internal*`

<a id="IERC165-supportsInterface"></a>

#### `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) → bool *public*`

See IERC165-supportsInterface.

Time complexity O(1), guaranteed to always use less than 30 000 gas.

<a id="IERC165-_registerInterface"></a>

#### `_registerInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) *internal*`

Registers the contract as an implementer of the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. Support of the actual ERC165 interface is automatic and
registering its interface id is not required.

See IERC165-supportsInterface.

Requirements:

* `interfaceId` cannot be the ERC165 invalid interface (`0xffffffff`).

### ``ERC165Checker``

Library used to query support of an interface declared via IERC165.

Note that these functions return the actual result of the query: they do not
`revert` if an interface is not supported. It is up to the caller to decide
what to do in these cases.

**Functions**

* [`supportsERC165(account)`](#ERC165Checker-supportsERC165-address-)
* [`supportsInterface(account, interfaceId)`](#ERC165Checker-supportsInterface-address-bytes4-)
* [`getSupportedInterfaces(account, interfaceIds)`](#ERC165Checker-getSupportedInterfaces-address-bytes4-)
* [`supportsAllInterfaces(account, interfaceIds)`](#ERC165Checker-supportsAllInterfaces-address-bytes4-)

<a id="IERC165-supportsERC165"></a>

#### `supportsERC165(address account) → bool *internal*`

Returns true if `account` supports the IERC165 interface,

<a id="IERC165-supportsInterface"></a>

#### `supportsInterface(address account, bytes4 interfaceId) → bool *internal*`

Returns true if `account` supports the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. Support for IERC165 itself is queried automatically.

See IERC165-supportsInterface.

<a id="IERC165-getSupportedInterfaces"></a>

#### `getSupportedInterfaces(address account, bytes4[] interfaceIds) → bool[] *internal*`

Returns a boolean array where each value corresponds to the
interfaces passed in and whether they’re supported or not. This allows
you to batch check interfaces for a contract where your expectation
is that some interfaces may not be supported.

See IERC165-supportsInterface.

_Available since v3.4._

<a id="IERC165-supportsAllInterfaces"></a>

#### `supportsAllInterfaces(address account, bytes4[] interfaceIds) → bool *internal*`

Returns true if `account` supports all the interfaces defined in
`interfaceIds`. Support for IERC165 itself is queried automatically.

Batch-querying can lead to gas savings by skipping repeated checks for
IERC165 support.

See IERC165-supportsInterface.

## Global

### ``IERC1820Registry``

Interface of the global ERC1820 Registry, as defined in the
[EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820). Accounts may register
implementers for interfaces in this registry, as well as query support.

Implementers may be shared by multiple accounts, and can also implement more
than a single interface for each account. Contracts can implement interfaces
for themselves, but externally-owned accounts (EOA) must delegate this to a
contract.

IERC165 interfaces can also be queried via the registry.

For an in-depth explanation and source code analysis, see the EIP text.

**Functions**

* [`setManager(account, newManager)`](#IERC1820Registry-setManager-address-address-)
* [`getManager(account)`](#IERC1820Registry-getManager-address-)
* [`setInterfaceImplementer(account, _interfaceHash, implementer)`](#IERC1820Registry-setInterfaceImplementer-address-bytes32-address-)
* [`getInterfaceImplementer(account, _interfaceHash)`](#IERC1820Registry-getInterfaceImplementer-address-bytes32-)
* [`interfaceHash(interfaceName)`](#IERC1820Registry-interfaceHash-string-)

* [`implementsERC165Interface(account, interfaceId)`](#IERC1820Registry-implementsERC165Interface-address-bytes4-)
* [`implementsERC165InterfaceNoCache(account, interfaceId)`](#IERC1820Registry-implementsERC165InterfaceNoCache-address-bytes4-)

**Events**

* [`InterfaceImplementerSet(account, interfaceHash, implementer)`](#IERC1820Registry-InterfaceImplementerSet-address-bytes32-address-)
* [`ManagerChanged(account, newManager)`](#IERC1820Registry-ManagerChanged-address-address-)

<a id="IERC165-setManager"></a>

#### `setManager(address account, address newManager) *external*`

Sets `newManager` as the manager for `account`. A manager of an
account is able to set interface implementers for it.

By default, each account is its own manager. Passing a value of `0x0` in
`newManager` will reset the manager to this initial state.

Emits a ManagerChanged event.

Requirements:

* the caller must be the current manager for `account`.

<a id="IERC165-getManager"></a>

#### `getManager(address account) → address *external*`

Returns the manager for `account`.

See setManager.

<a id="IERC165-setInterfaceImplementer"></a>

#### `setInterfaceImplementer(address account, bytes32 _interfaceHash, address implementer) *external*`

Sets the `implementer` contract as ``account`’s implementer for
`interfaceHash`.

`account` being the zero address is an alias for the caller’s address.
The zero address can also be used in `implementer` to remove an old one.

See interfaceHash to learn how these are created.

Emits an InterfaceImplementerSet event.

Requirements:

* the caller must be the current manager for `account`.
* `interfaceHash` must not be an IERC165 interface id (i.e. it must not
end in 28 zeroes).
* `implementer` must implement IERC1820Implementer and return true when
queried for support, unless `implementer` is the caller. See
IERC1820Implementer-canImplementInterfaceForAddress.

<a id="IERC165-getInterfaceImplementer"></a>

#### `getInterfaceImplementer(address account, bytes32 _interfaceHash) → address *external*`

Returns the implementer of `interfaceHash` for `account`. If no such
implementer is registered, returns the zero address.

If `interfaceHash` is an IERC165 interface id (i.e. it ends with 28
zeroes), `account` will be queried for support of it.

`account` being the zero address is an alias for the caller’s address.

<a id="IERC165-interfaceHash"></a>

#### `interfaceHash(string interfaceName) → bytes32 *external*`

Returns the interface hash for an `interfaceName`, as defined in the
corresponding
[section of the EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820#interface-name).

<a id="IERC165-updateERC165Cache"></a>

#### `updateERC165Cache(address account, bytes4 interfaceId) *external*`

<a id="IERC165-implementsERC165Interface"></a>

#### `implementsERC165Interface(address account, bytes4 interfaceId) → bool *external*`

<a id="IERC165-implementsERC165InterfaceNoCache"></a>

#### `implementsERC165InterfaceNoCache(address account, bytes4 interfaceId) → bool *external*`

<a id="IERC165-InterfaceImplementerSet"></a>

#### `InterfaceImplementerSet(address account, bytes32 interfaceHash, address implementer) *event*`

<a id="IERC165-ManagerChanged"></a>

#### `ManagerChanged(address account, address newManager) *event*`

### ``IERC1820Implementer``

Interface for an ERC1820 implementer, as defined in the
[EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820#interface-implementation-erc1820implementerinterface).
Used by contracts that will be registered as implementers in the
IERC1820Registry.

**Functions**

* [`canImplementInterfaceForAddress(interfaceHash, account)`](#IERC1820Implementer-canImplementInterfaceForAddress-bytes32-address-)

<a id="IERC165-canImplementInterfaceForAddress"></a>

#### `canImplementInterfaceForAddress(bytes32 interfaceHash, address account) → bytes32 *external*`

Returns a special value (`ERC1820_ACCEPT_MAGIC`) if this contract
implements `interfaceHash` for `account`.

See IERC1820Registry-setInterfaceImplementer.

### ``ERC1820Implementer``

Implementation of the IERC1820Implementer interface.

Contracts may inherit from this and call _registerInterfaceForAddress to
declare their willingness to be implementers.
IERC1820Registry-setInterfaceImplementer should then be called for the
registration to be complete.

**Functions**

* [`canImplementInterfaceForAddress(interfaceHash, account)`](#ERC1820Implementer-canImplementInterfaceForAddress-bytes32-address-)
* [`_registerInterfaceForAddress(interfaceHash, account)`](#ERC1820Implementer-_registerInterfaceForAddress-bytes32-address-)

<a id="IERC165-canImplementInterfaceForAddress"></a>

#### `canImplementInterfaceForAddress(bytes32 interfaceHash, address account) → bytes32 *public*`

<a id="IERC165-_registerInterfaceForAddress"></a>

#### `_registerInterfaceForAddress(bytes32 interfaceHash, address account) *internal*`

Declares the contract as willing to be an implementer of
`interfaceHash` for `account`.

See IERC1820Registry-setInterfaceImplementer and
IERC1820Registry-interfaceHash.
