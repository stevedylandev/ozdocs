[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/access/ownable)

## Overview

The Ownable module provides a simple access control mechanism where a contract has a single account (owner) that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions. This pattern is useful for contracts that need a straightforward authorization system with a single privileged account.

## Key Concepts

### Ownership Management

The system designates a single owner with exclusive access to functions marked with the `#[only_owner]` macro. The initial owner must be ideally set during contract initialization for the module to function properly.

Like the Access Control module, ownership transfers are implemented as a two-step process to prevent accidental or malicious takeovers:

1. The current owner **initiates** the transfer by specifying the new owner and an expiration time (`live_until_ledger`).
2. The designated new owner must **explicitly accept** the transfer to complete it.

Until the transfer is accepted, the original owner retains full control and can override or cancel the transfer by initiating a new one or using a `live_until_ledger` of `0`.

### Ownership Renunciation

The Ownable module allows the owner to permanently renounce ownership of the contract. This is a one-way operation that cannot be undone. After ownership is renounced, all functions marked with `#[only_owner]` become permanently inaccessible.

This feature is useful for contracts that need to become fully decentralized after an initial setup phase.

### Procedural Macro

The module includes a procedural macro to simplify owner authorization checks:

#### @only_owner

Ensures the caller is the owner before executing the function:

```rust
#[only_owner]
pub fn restricted_function(e: &Env, other_param: u32) {
    // Function body - only accessible to owner
}
```

This expands to code that retrieves the owner from storage and requires authorization before executing the function body.

## Usage Example

Here’s a simple example of using the Ownable module:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Address, Env};
use stellar_ownable::{self as ownable, Ownable};
use stellar_ownable_macro::only_owner;

#[contract]
pub struct MyContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl MyContract {
    pub fn __constructor(e: &Env, initial_owner: Address) {
        // Set the contract owner
        ownable::set_owner(e, &initial_owner);
    }

    #[only_owner]
    pub fn update_config(e: &Env, new_value: u32) {
        // Only the owner can call this function
        // Implementation...
    }

    // This function is accessible to anyone
    pub fn get_config(e: &Env) -> u32 {
        // Implementation...
        42
    }
}
```

## Benefits and Trade-offs

### Benefits

* Simple and straightforward ownership model
* Secure two-step ownership transfer process
* Option to permanently renounce ownership
* Easy integration with procedural macro
* Event emission for important actions

### Trade-offs

* Limited to a single privileged account (compared to role-based systems)
* Once ownership is renounced, privileged functions become permanently inaccessible
