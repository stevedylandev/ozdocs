title: Non-Fungible Token
---

[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/src/non-fungible)

In the world of digital assets, not all tokens are alike. This becomes important in situations
like **real estate**, **voting rights**, or **collectibles**, where some items are valued more than
others due to their usefulness, rarity, etc.
On Stellar, you can create non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where each token is unique and
represents something distinct, with ownership tracked through Soroban smart contracts.

## Overview

The [non-fungible](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/src/non-fungible) module
provides three different NFT variants that differ in how certain features like ownership tracking,
token creation and destruction are handled:

1. **Base**: Contract variant that implements the base logic for the NonFungibleToken interface. Suitable for most use cases.
2. **Consecutive**: Contract variant for optimized minting of batches of tokens. Builds on top of the base variant, and overrides the necessary functions from the `Base` variant.
3. **Enumerable**: Contract variant that allows enumerating the tokens on-chain. Builds on top of the base variant, and overrides the necessary functions from the `Base` variant.

These three variants share core functionality and a common interface, exposing identical contract functions as
entry-points. However, composing custom flows must be handled with extra caution. That is required because of the
incompatible nature between the business logic of the different NFT variants or the need to wrap the base
functionality with additional logic.

## Usage

We’ll use an NFT to track game items, each having their own unique attributes. Whenever one is to be
awarded to a player, it will be minted and sent to them. Players are free to keep or burn their token or
trade it with other people as they see fit. Please note any account can call `award_item` and we might
want to implement access control to restrict who can mint.

Here’s what a contract for tokenized items might look like:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Address, Env, String};
use stellar_macros::default_impl;
use stellar_tokens::non_fungible::{
    burnable::NonFungibleBurnable,
    Base, ContractOverrides, NonFungibleToken,
};

#[contract]
pub struct GameItem;

#[contractimpl]
impl GameItem {
    pub fn __constructor(e: &Env) {
        Base::set_metadata(
            e,
            String::from_str(e, "www.mygame.com"),
            String::from_str(e, "My Game Items Collection"),
            String::from_str(e, "MGMC"),
        );
    }

    pub fn award_item(e: &Env, to: Address) -> u32 {
        // access control might be needed
        Base::sequential_mint(e, &to)
    }
}

#[default_impl]
#[contractimpl]
impl NonFungibleToken for GameItem {
    type ContractType = Base;
}

#[default_impl]
#[contractimpl]
impl NonFungibleBurnable for GameItem {}
```

## Extensions

The following optional extensions are provided to enhance capabilities:

### - Burnable
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/src/non-fungible/extensions/burnable)

The `NonFungibleBurnable` trait extends the `NonFungibleToken` trait to provide the capability to burn tokens.

### - Consecutive
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/src/non-fungible/extensions/consecutive)

The `NonFungibleConsecutive` extension is optimized for batch minting of tokens with consecutive IDs. This approach drastically reduces storage writes during minting by storing ownership only at boundaries and inferring ownership for other tokens. See [Non-Fungible Consecutive](/stellar-contracts/tokens/non-fungible/nft-consecutive) for detailed documentation.

This extension is build around the contract variant `Consecutive`. Here is an example usage:

* [Non-Fungible Consecutive](/stellar-contracts/tokens/non-fungible/nft-consecutive)

### - Enumerable
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/src/non-fungible/extensions/enumerable)

The `NonFungibleEnumerable` extension enables on-chain enumeration of tokens owned by an address. See [Non-Fungible Enumerable](/stellar-contracts/tokens/non-fungible/nft-enumerable) for detailed documentation.

This extension is build around the contract variant `Enumerable`. Here is an example usage:

* [Non-Fungible Enumerable](/stellar-contracts/tokens/non-fungible/nft-enumerable)

### - Royalties
[Source Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/tokens/src/non-fungible/extensions/royalties)

The `NonFungibleRoyalties` trait extends the `NonFungibleToken` trait to provide royalty information for tokens, similar to ERC-2981 standard. This allows marketplaces to query royalty information and pay appropriate fees to creators.

Note: The royalties extension allows both collection-wide default royalties and per-token royalty settings.
