This crate provides a collection of macros that streamline and simplify development with the library.
To use them, you need to add the `openzeppelin_macros` crate as a dependency in your `Scarb.toml` file:

```toml
openzeppelin_macros = "{{umbrella_version}}"
```

## Attribute macros

* [with_components](./macros/with_components)
